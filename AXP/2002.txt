ITEM 1. BUSINESS

                                  INTRODUCTION

      American Express Company (including its subsidiaries, unless the context
indicates otherwise, the "Company") was founded in 1850 as a joint stock
association and was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in
1965. The Company is primarily engaged in the business of providing travel
related services, financial advisory services and international banking services
throughout the world.*

      2001 was an extremely challenging year for the Company. In the first half
of the year the Company's businesses were affected by a weakening economy,
depressed equity markets, historically high default rates for high yield
securities and a sharp slowdown in spending by Cardmembers. The terrorist
attacks of September 11, 2001 further affected the Company by decreasing
corporate and consumer spending and travel, as well as investment activity, and
dislocated the Company from its headquarters at the World Financial Center in
New York City. (For a discussion of how these developments negatively affected
the financial results of the Company, see pages 28 through 47 under the caption
"Financial Review," and Notes 2, 3, and 4 on pages 53 through 57 of the
Company's 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, which portions of such report are
incorporated herein by reference.)

      Partly as a response to the difficult economic and business environment in
2001, the Company pursued three major initiatives to improve its business
performance.

      o     First, the Company sought to strengthen its business model through
            numerous initiatives including expanding the diversity of the card
            base and product portfolio; growing the credit card lending
            business; enhancing and diversifying the MEMBERSHIP REWARDS'r'
            loyalty program; improving the economics of the Corporate Travel
            business; and accelerating reengineering efforts, such as the
            migration of internal and external processes to the Internet, among
            many other initiatives.

            The reengineering initiatives delivered over $1 billion in gross
            realized benefits during the year and serve not only to support the
            Company's financial results, but also to establish the foundation
            for sustainable, long-term growth. While a portion of the savings
            from reengineering has gone into improving the Company's operating
            margins, some of the savings also have been invested in growth
            opportunities, including investments in new products, customer
            acquisition and more efficient technology platforms that will help
            employees do their jobs and service the Company's customers more
            effectively.

      o     Second, the Company addressed certain risks in its businesses. It
            lowered its exposure to high-yield investments; moved further away
            from the corporate banking business toward more broad-based consumer
            activities; and maintained strong reserve coverage to address credit
            quality in the card portfolio.

      o     Third, the Company has been pursuing strategic investments in key
            areas of its global payments and retail financial services
            businesses. This includes expanding the consumer, small business

            and commercial card businesses, and improving the investment
            performance and breadth of products at American Express Financial
            Advisors.

            These and other developments are more fully described below.

                             TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES

      American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (including its
subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise, "TRS") provides a variety
of products and services, including, among others, global card network, issuing
and processing services, the American Express'r' Card, the Optima'r' Card, a
number of co-brand Cards, other consumer and corporate lending and banking
products, a network of automated teller machines ("ATMs"), the American
Express'r' Travelers Cheque, stored value products, business expense management
products and services, corporate and consumer travel products and services, tax,
accounting and business consulting services, magazine publishing, merchant
transaction processing and point of sale and back office products and services.
TRS offers products and services worldwide. In certain countries, partly owned
affiliates and unaffiliated entities offer some of these products and services
under licenses from TRS.

      TRS' business as a whole has not experienced significant seasonal
fluctuation, although Travelers Cheque sales and Travelers Cheques outstanding
tend to be greatest each year in the summer months, peaking in the third
quarter, and Card-billed business tends to be moderately higher in the fourth
quarter than in other quarters.

      TRS places significant importance on its trademarks and service marks and
diligently protects its intellectual property rights around the world.

      GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES

      TRS operates a global general purpose card network. Network functions
include operations, service delivery, systems, authorization, clearing,
settlement and brand advertising and marketing; the development of new and
innovative products for the network; and establishing and enhancing
relationships with millions of merchants globally, both online and offline.

      One of the key assets of TRS' network is the American Express brand, which
is one of the world's most highly recognized and respected brands. Cards bearing
the American Express logo ("Cards") are issued by qualified institutions and are
accepted at ATMs and at all merchant locations worldwide that accept the
American Express Card.

      TRS is the largest issuer of Cards on the American Express global network.
In addition, as of December 31, 2001, there were 74 arrangements in place with
banks and other qualified institutions in nearly 80 countries providing for Card
issuance by those entities. These partnerships create more American Express
branded cards in force, drive more transaction volume through the American
Express merchant network and significantly expand the reach of the American
Express brand. Global Network Services partners have been responsible for adding
over 1.86 million new merchant outlets that accept Cards, a significant addition
to the American Express international merchant base. Global Network Services
continued to show strong growth in billed business in 2001.

      Among the new agreements announced in 2001 for cards to be issued on the
American Express global network were those with Union Bank Limited in Pakistan;
HSBC and Scotiabank Quilmes in Argentina; and Unibanca in Venezuela. Early in
2002, TRS announced an agreement with Canada's leading credit card issuer,
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), which became the first


<Page>

                                                                               3


Canadian bank to offer both American Express and VISA credit cards to its
customers. CIBC is issuing a suite of American Express-branded credit cards,
including Canada's first smart chip credit card available nationally. This
agreement represents TRS' first Card-issuing partnership in Canada and is an
important step toward expanding its brand presence in that country.

      While some of TRS' other partnership arrangements have been in place for
more than 20 years, the vast majority have been established since 1995. In May
1996, the Company invited banks and other qualified institutions in the United
States to begin issuing Cards on the American Express network. In 1997, the
Company established Global Network Services to manage its network business,
bringing increased focus and resources to this area.

      In contrast to the situation outside the United States, there are no major
U.S. bank issuers on the American Express network in the United States. This is
the result of rules and policies of VISA USA, Inc. and MasterCard International,
Incorporated ("MasterCard") in the United States calling for expulsion of
members who issue American Express branded cards. No banks have been willing to
forfeit membership in VISA USA, Inc. and/or MasterCard to issue cards on the
American Express network. In a lawsuit filed in October 1998 against VISA USA,
Inc. and VISA International Corp. (collectively, "VISA") and MasterCard, the
U.S. Department of Justice alleged that these rules and policies violate the
antitrust laws of the United States. In October, 2001, the trial judge ruled in
favor of the U.S. Department of Justice, holding that these rules and policies
do violate such laws. TRS views this decision as a major victory for U.S.
consumers because it will ultimately lead to more vigorous competition and more
innovative card products and services. However, VISA and MasterCard have
indicated that they intend to appeal this decision and have obtained a stay of
the court's judgment while the appeal is pending.

      As a network, TRS encounters intense worldwide competition from other card
networks such as VISA, MasterCard, Diners Club, Discover Financial Services, a
business unit of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. (U.S. only) and JCB. The
principal competitive factors that affect the network business are (i) the
number of cards in force and extent of spending done with these cards; (ii) the
quantity and quality of establishments that accept the cards; (iii) the success
of targeted marketing and promotional campaigns; (iv) reputation and brand
recognition; (v) the ability to develop and implement innovative systems and
technologies cost effectively on a global basis; (vi) the ability to develop and
implement innovative types of card products and support services for merchants
and issuers and acquirers on the network; (vii) success in implementation of
strategies to reduce suppression -- when merchants that accept cards encourage a
customer to use another card or cash; (viii) the availability of alternative
payment systems; and, (ix) the quality of customer service.

           CONSUMER CARD, SMALL BUSINESS AND CONSUMER TRAVEL SERVICES

      TRS and its licensees offer individual consumers charge cards such as the
American Express'r' Card, the American Express'r' Gold Card, the Platinum
Card'r' and the ultra-premium Centurion'sm' Card; revolving credit cards such as
the Optima'r' Card, Blue from American Express'sm' and the Delta SkyMiles'r'
Credit Card from American Express, among others; and a variety of cards
sponsored by and co-branded with other corporations and institutions, such as
the American Express'r' Platinum Cash Rebate Card exclusively for Costco Members
and the American Express'r' Corporate Card from OPEN: The Small Business Network
exclusively for Costco Members. Cards are currently issued in 43 currencies
(including cards issued by banks and other qualified institutions) and permit
Cardmembers to charge purchases of goods or services in the United States and in
most countries around the world at establishments that have agreed to accept
Cards, and to access cash through ATMs at more than 500,000 locations worldwide.

                                                                               4


      Charge Cards, which are marketed in the U.S. and many other countries and
carry no pre-set spending limits, are primarily designed as a method of payment
and not as a means of financing purchases of goods or services. Charges are
approved based on a variety of factors including a Cardmember's account history,
credit record and personal resources. Charge Cards generally require payment by
the Cardmember of the full amount billed each month, and no finance charges are
assessed. Charge Card accounts that are past due are subject, in most cases, to
a delinquency assessment and, if not brought to current status, may be
cancelled.

      TRS and its licensees also offer a variety of revolving credit cards in
the United States and other countries. These cards have a range of different
payment terms, grace periods and rate and fee structures. Since late 1994, when
the Company began to aggressively expand its credit card business, its lending
balance growth has been among the top tier of card issuers. Much of this growth
has been due to the breadth of the Company's lending products -- such as Blue
from American Express and the Delta Skymiles Credit Card from American Express
- -- as well as the increased number of Charge Cardmembers who have taken
advantage of the Company's "lending on charge" options (such as Sign & Travel).
In 2001, about 19 percent of the Company's U.S. card billings came from the
Company's lending products, as compared with just four percent in 1995. TRS also
continues to expand its consumer lending activities in key markets outside the
U.S., primarily through the introduction and increased distribution of new
revolving credit card products. This change in product mix has shifted the
Company's overall card revenue base and helped to make it less susceptible to a
short-term downturn in the economy.

      American Express Centurion Bank ("Centurion Bank"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of TRS, issues the Optima Card, Blue from American Express and all
other American Express branded revolving credit cards in the United States and
owns most of the receivables arising from the use of these Cards. In addition,
Centurion Bank has outstanding lines of credit in association with certain
Charge Cards and offers unsecured loans to Cardmembers in connection with its
Sign & Travel and Extended Payment Option programs. The Sign & Travel program
gives qualified U.S. Cardmembers the option of extended payments for airline,
cruise and certain travel charges that are purchased with the Charge Card. The
Extended Payment Option offers qualified U.S. Cardmembers the option of
extending payment for certain charges on the Charge Card in excess of a
specified amount.

      Centurion Bank is also the issuer of certain Charge Cards in the U.S. In
addition, it offers Membership B@nking'r' -- a direct banking service that
provides consumers with high-value products, such as ATM access with rebates on
surcharges from other banks, competitive rates on deposits and lending products
and the convenience of banking by the Internet, telephone, ATM or mail.

      Centurion Bank's deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ("FDIC") up to $100,000 per depositor. Centurion Bank is a
Utah-chartered industrial loan company regulated, supervised and regularly
examined by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC.

      Many TRS Cardmembers, particularly Charge Card holders, are charged an
annual fee, which varies based on the type of card, the number of cards for each
account, the currency in which the card is denominated and the country of
residence of the Cardmember. Most revolving credit cards are offered with no
annual fee. Each Cardmember must meet standards and criteria for
creditworthiness which are applied through a variety of means both at the time
of initial solicitation or application and on an ongoing basis during the Card
relationship. The Company uses sophisticated credit models and techniques in its
risk management operations.

                                                                               5


      As part of the Company-wide effort in 2001 to further reduce certain risks
in its businesses, TRS continued to maintain strong reserve coverage to address
credit quality in its charge card and lending portfolio. In this regard TRS
increased its reserve coverage of total receivables and loans, and coverage of
past due balances remained in excess of 100 percent.

      TRS is concerned about fraud throughout its Card operations. The Company
continues to take measures to address fraud issues, including investing in new
technologies and educating Cardmembers through fraud protection initiatives. The
Company had success in reducing known fraud in 2001.

      Cardmembers have access to a variety of special services and programs,
depending on the type of Card they have and their country of residence. These
include the MEMBERSHIP REWARDS'r' program, Global Assist'r' Hotline, Buyer's
Assurance Plan, Car Rental Loss and Damage Insurance, Travel Accident Insurance,
Purchase Protection Plan, Best Value Guarantee, Emergency Card Replacement,
Emergency Check Cashing Privileges, Automatic Flight Insurance, Premium Baggage
Protection, Private Payments'sm', Assured Reservations and Online Fraud
Protection Guarantee. Gold Cardmembers in the United States have access to
certain additional services, including a Year-End Summary of Charges Report. The
Platinum Card, offered to certain Cardmembers in the United States and various
other countries, provides access to additional and enhanced travel, financial,
insurance, personal assistance and other services. The Centurion Card is an
ultra-premium charge card providing highly personalized customer service and an
array of travel, lifestyle and financial benefits. Personal, Gold, Platinum Card
and Centurion Cardmembers receive the Customer Relationship Statement, which is
used to communicate special offers for products and services of both merchants
and the Company.

      Examples of services offered for a fee to Cardmembers include travel,
accident and credit insurance products, a card registry and replacement service,
credit bureau monitoring and telecommunication services. Additional services
include a subscription service for magazines, a pre-paid legal service and
various merchandise-related offerings.

      TRS has significantly expanded the diversity of its card-spending base to
increase the use of its cards for everyday spending at such places as
supermarkets, gas stations and retailers, as well as for telecommunications.
Consumers tend to maintain their level of spending in these areas even during
periods of economic weakness. Over the past ten years, TRS also has
significantly expanded the roster of merchants who accept its card products. In
1990, 65 percent of all of TRS' U.S. billings came from the travel and
entertainment sectors and 35 percent from retail and other sectors. In 2001 that
proportion was essentially reversed, with everyday spending accounting for about
60 percent of the business billed on American Express Cards. In 2001, this shift
was very important due to a decrease in Cardmember spending in travel and
entertainment.

      Several products launched or renewed by TRS in the United States in the
last few years continued to make significant contributions to its results in
2001. Blue from American Express was the first widely marketed credit card in
the United States with an embedded smart chip, currently designed to provide
added security for online purchases and loyalty benefits. TRS is actively
pursuing additional applications for the chip. TRS' co-brand card partnerships
with both Delta Air Lines and Costco also have added millions of highly
profitable Cardmembers to TRS' base over the past several years.

      TRS has also continued to enhance its MEMBERSHIP REWARDS program to expand
rewards opportunities beyond travel to the retail and online sectors. More than
700 partners now participate in the MEMBERSHIP REWARDS program worldwide. TRS'
industry-leading MEMBERSHIP REWARDS loyalty program, with more than nine million
enrollees worldwide, continues to be a strong driver of Cardmember retention
and profitability. In the United States, the average profitability of a
MEMBERSHIP REWARDS enrollee is

                                                                               6


significantly higher than non-enrollees as a result of higher spending, lower
credit losses and more favorable attrition rates.

      TRS makes payments to merchants pursuant to contractual arrangements when
Cardmembers redeem their MEMBERSHIP REWARDS points and establishes reserves in
connection with estimated future redemptions. Due to higher charge volumes and
reward redemption costs, the expense of MEMBERSHIP REWARDS has increased over
the past several years and continues to grow. During 2001 TRS worked to reduce
program-related costs. Cardmembers can now handle online many program-related
activities, such as enrollment and point redemption. By offering a broader range
of redemption choices, TRS has improved customer satisfaction and lowered
overall reward costs. TRS will continue to seek ways to contain the overall cost
of the program and make changes to enhance its value to Cardmembers.

      In addition to using the Internet to support MEMBERSHIP REWARDS, TRS
continued to deliver other online tools to help its customers effectively manage
their relationships with the Company. As a result, the Company now handles more
U.S. Card customer service transactions on the Internet than it does by
telephone, mail or in person. The Internet has also proven to be a powerful and
cost-effective tool for acquiring new customers. During 2001, 14 percent of all
new Cardmembers in the U.S. were acquired online (16 percent of all U.S.
consumer cards).

      TRS continues to make significant investments in its card processing
system and infrastructure to allow faster introduction and greater customization
of products. TRS also is utilizing technology to develop and improve its service
capabilities. For example, TRS developed the Service Delivery Platform that its
employees utilize in the consumer card business to support a variety of customer
servicing and account management activities such as account maintenance,
updating of Cardmember information, the addition of new cards to an account and
customer satisfaction issues. See "Corporate and Other" for a description of the
Company's arrangement to out-task most of its technology operations to IBM.

      TRS is also a leading provider of financial and travel services to small
businesses (i.e., generally less than 100 employees and/or sales of $10 million
or less) -- a key growth area in the United States. Recently, TRS took steps to
strengthen its competitive position in this customer segment by introducing a
new set of products, services, customer communications and partnerships, as well
as increasing the use of the Internet to meet the servicing needs of small
business owners in the United States. As part of this initiative, TRS' Small
Business Services Group adopted a new name -- OPEN: The Small Business
Network'sm' ("OSBN") -- and introduced a national advertising campaign to signal
TRS' broadened commitment to helping small business owners succeed. The campaign
underscored the greater control over payment and financing that OSBN provides to
its customers.

      During 2001, OSBN continued to achieve strong growth as demonstrated by
year-over-year increases in spending on cards and loans outstanding. OSBN is a
leading card issuer to the small business segment and one of the largest lenders
to small businesses in the United States, serving nearly three million small
business customers. Over the past five years, OSBN has broadened its product
offerings to include equipment leasing, unsecured lines of credit and term
loans.

      TRS encounters substantial and increasingly intense competition with
respect to the Card issuing business. As a card issuer, TRS competes in the U.S.
with financial institutions (such as Citibank, Bank One/First USA, MBNA, JP
Morgan Chase and Capital One Financial) that are members of VISA and/or
MasterCard and that issue general purpose cards, primarily under revolving
credit plans, on one or both of those systems, and the Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter & Co. affiliate that issues the Discover Card on the Discover Business
Services network. TRS also encounters some very limited competition from
businesses that issue their own cards or otherwise extend credit to their
customers, such as retailers and



<Page>

                                                                               7


airline associations, although these cards are not generally substitutes for
TRS' Cards due to their limited acceptance.

      Competing card issuers offer a variety of products and services to attract
cardholders including premium cards with enhanced services or lines of credit,
airline frequent flyer program mileage credits and other reward or rebate
programs, "teaser" promotional interest rates for both card acquisition and
balance transfers, and co-branded arrangements with partners that offer benefits
to cardholders. The trend of mergers and consolidations among banking and
financial services companies and credit card portfolio acquisitions by major
card issuers has continued, resulting in some issuers becoming even larger, with
greater resources, economies of scale and brand recognition to compete -- and a
smaller number of significant issuers.

      Most financial institutions which offer demand deposit accounts also issue
debit cards to permit depositors to access their funds. Use of debit cards for
point of sale purchases has continued to increase as many financial institutions
have replaced ATM cards with general purpose debit cards bearing either the VISA
or MasterCard logo and accepted wherever those branded credit cards are
accepted. As a result, the volume of transactions made with debit cards has
increased significantly. These transactions are typically for small dollar
amounts and would otherwise have been made using cash and checks. Debit cards
are not generally substitutes for credit or charge cards. TRS does not currently
offer point of sale debit card products in any significant way.

      The principal competitive factors that affect the Card-issuing business
are (i) the features and the quality of the services and products, including
rewards programs provided to cardmembers; (ii) the number, spending
characteristics and credit performance of cardmembers; (iii) the quantity and
quality of the establishments that accept a card; (iv) the cost of cards to
cardmembers; (v) the terms of payment available to cardmembers; (vi) the number
and quality of other payment instruments available to cardmembers; (vii) the
nature and quality of expense management data capture and reporting capability;
(viii) the success of targeted marketing and promotional campaigns; (ix)
reputation and brand recognition; (x) the ability of issuers to implement
operational and cost efficiencies; and (xi) the quality of customer service.

      American Express Credit Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRS,
along with its subsidiaries ("Credco"), purchases most Charge Card receivables
arising from the use of cards issued in the United States and in designated
currencies outside the United States. Credco finances the purchase of
receivables principally through the issuance of commercial paper and the sale of
medium- and long-term notes. Centurion Bank finances its revolving credit
receivables through the sale of short- and medium-term notes and certificates of
deposit. TRS and Centurion Bank also fund receivables through asset
securitization programs. The cost of funding Cardmember receivables and loans is
a major expense of Card operations. For a further discussion of TRS' and
Centurion Bank's financing activities, see pages 30 through 33 and pages 38
through 41 under the caption "Financial Review," and Note 6 on pages 58 through
59 of the Company's 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, which portions of such
report are incorporated herein by reference.

      The Charge Card, ATM and consumer lending businesses are subject to
extensive regulation in the United States under a number of federal laws and
regulations, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (which generally
prohibits discrimination in the granting and handling of credit); the Fair
Credit Reporting Act (which, among other things, regulates use by creditors of
consumer credit reports and credit prescreening practices and requires certain
disclosures when an application for credit is rejected); the Truth in Lending
Act (which, among other things, requires extensive disclosure of the terms upon
which credit is granted); the Fair Credit Billing Act (which, among other
things, regulates the manner in which billing inquiries are handled and
specifies certain billing requirements); the Fair Credit and Charge

                                                                               8


Card Disclosure Act (which mandates certain disclosures on credit and charge
card applications); and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (which regulates
disclosures and settlement of transactions for electronic funds transfers
including those at ATMs). Certain federal privacy-related laws and regulations
govern the collection and use of customer information by financial institutions
(see page 34). Federal legislation also regulates abusive debt collection
practices. In addition, a number of states and foreign countries have similar
consumer credit protection, disclosure and privacy-related laws. The application
of federal and state bankruptcy and debtor relief laws affect the Company to the
extent that such laws result in amounts owed being classified as delinquent
and/or charged off as uncollectible. Centurion Bank is subject to a variety of
state and federal laws and regulations applicable to FDIC-insured,
state-chartered financial institutions. Changes in such laws and regulations or
judicial interpretation thereof could impact the manner in which Centurion Bank
conducts its business.

      The American Express Consumer Travel business has four segments: American
Express-owned travel service offices; American Express representatives, which
are travel offices independently owned by third parties; American Express remote
delivery call centers, which offer travel services to Platinum Card, Centurion
Card and other Cardmembers; and a wholesale travel business comprised of two
subsidiaries -- Travel Impressions and Golden Bear Travel. Through these
facilities, Cardmembers are able to receive service in person, by phone or by
fax, in addition to the Company's online servicing. Since a large number of the
Company's consumer and small business Cardmembers are also active leisure
travelers, TRS seeks to use its consumer travel network to better serve its
customers and grow the business despite extremely challenging competitive
pressures. See pages 10-11 for a discussion of competition in the travel
industry.

      TRS' travel network of more than 1,700 travel locations is important in
supporting the American Express brand and providing customer service throughout
the world. TRS continually evaluates this structure to determine the best way to
leverage the strength of the travel network. At the same time, TRS is developing
ways to better serve the travel consumer, including 1-800 type services and
Internet-based products and services.

      MERCHANT SERVICES

      Over the past several years, TRS' Establishment Services Group has focused
on expanding the TRS network of merchants who accept TRS' Card products and
increasing merchant acceptance globally. In 2001, TRS continued to see strong
progress in merchant signings worldwide. TRS' focus on increasing Card usage in
retail and everyday spend categories led to a shift in Card spending mix, which
resulted in increased growth of card spending in merchants such as drug stores
and supermarkets.

      During the year, TRS strengthened its merchant coverage in the United
States in various industries, including government, supermarkets, insurance,
telecommunications, and business-to-business. Key signings in the United States
included Pathmark Supermarkets, REI (sporting goods) and Qwest Communications
International Inc. The merchant network in the United States can now accommodate
more than 95 percent of American Express Cardmembers' general purpose plastic
spending. TRS' objective is to achieve merchant coverage wherever and however
Cardmembers want to use the Card. In the United States, TRS acquires merchants
through a number of sales channels: a proprietary sales force, third-party sales
agents, the Internet and telemarketing.

      As a merchant acquirer, TRS accepts and processes from each participating
establishment the charges arising from Cardmember purchases at a discount that
varies with the type of participating establishment, the charge volume, the
timing and method of payment to the establishment, the method of submission of
charges and, in certain instances, the average charge amount and the amount of
information provided. As a result of TRS' attractive Cardmember base with loyal,
high-spending Personal and



<Page>

                                                                               9


Corporate Cardmembers, TRS is generally able to charge higher discount rates to
participating establishments than its competitors. While many establishments
understand this pricing in relation to the value provided, TRS has encountered
complaints from some establishments, as well as suppression of the Card's use.
TRS continues to devote significant resources to respond to this issue, and has
made progress by concentrating on acquiring merchants where Cardmembers want to
use the Card, providing better and earlier communication of the American Express
value proposition and, when necessary, by canceling merchants who suppress usage
of the American Express Card.

      TRS focuses on understanding and addressing key factors that influence
merchant satisfaction, on executing programs that increase Card usage at
merchants and on strengthening its relationships with merchants through an
expanded roster of services that help them meet their business goals. TRS is
also using the Internet to enhance merchant relationships with the Company. In
2001, TRS launched two services which are designed to support merchants' billing
needs. TRS introduced Purchase-Express'r', which enables merchants to authorize
and settle transactions from their PCs and capture additional data to support
the enhanced reporting provided to Corporate Purchasing Card clients. TRS also
launched the Automated Bill Payment Platform, which allows merchants to bill
Cardmembers on a regular basis for repeated charges such as insurance premiums
and subscriptions. TRS also enhanced the online card acceptance application and
expanded functionality and information available within the Online Merchant
Services site.

      Wherever TRS manages both the acquiring relationship with merchants and
the Card-issuing side of the business, there is a "closed loop," which
distinguishes the American Express network from the bank card networks in that
there is access to information at both ends of the Card transaction. This
enables TRS to provide targeted marketing opportunities for merchants and
special offers to Cardmembers through a variety of channels.

      In the days following September 11, 2001, TRS demonstrated its deep
commitment to its merchant customers when TRS merchant client managers contacted
over 10,000 merchants in the New York City area either in person or via
telephone. Where telecommunications had been negatively affected, TRS employees
acted quickly to establish alternative means for merchants to route
transactions, and to help reduce the disruption to their business. In addition,
TRS invested marketing dollars and other marketing support in the New York City
and Washington, D.C. areas to help merchants recover lost business, including
supporting the National Restaurant Association in a nationwide promotion to
stimulate business.

      During 2001, TRS addressed credit quality issues on the merchant side of
its business and the growing risk related to merchant bankruptcies in light of
the difficult economy and, in particular, after the September 11 terrorist
attacks. To reduce this risk -- particularly in the travel industry where
merchants may be paid by the Company prior to actually rendering the services to
Cardmembers -- the Company holds reserves where appropriate. In some cases, the
Company has instituted annual fees or lengthened the time between when the Card
charges are submitted by the merchant and when the Company pays the merchant.

      At year-end 2001, TRS was the third-largest owner/operator of ATMs in the
United States with more than 7,600 terminals. TRS built its own ATM network
largely through acquisitions from third parties in 1999 and 2000, and has
re-branded most of the network with the ATM Axis name. The ATM Axis'r' network
provides free transactions for Membership B@nking'r' customers. TRS is upgrading
its ATMs to offer services beyond dispensing cash, such as money transfer
services and retail couponing.

      CORPORATE SERVICES

      TRS' Corporate Services Group ("CSG") provides Corporate Card, Corporate
Travel, Corporate Purchasing Card and consulting services to leading
corporations around the world. Currently, CSG serves about 70 percent of the
Fortune 500 U.S. companies. CSG also has a strong presence among middle market
companies (those with revenues of $10 million to $1 billion), a sector in which
it plans to expand its business.

      CSG provides Corporate Charge Card payment and expense management services
to large and mid-sized companies for travel and entertainment spending.
Companies are offered these services through the American Express'r' Corporate
Card, which is a charge card issued to individuals through a corporate account
established by their employer for business purposes. During 2001, TRS added or
expanded Corporate Card relationships with a number of companies in the United
States, including Prudential, Invensys, Apple Computer, Inc., Delta Air Lines
and EDS/AT Kearney, as well as about 7,000 mid-sized companies.

      CSG also seeks to improve client company management of non-travel and
entertainment business expenses through the Corporate Purchasing Card. This
product assists large and middle market companies in managing indirect spending,
including traditional purchasing administration expenses. Employees can use the
Purchasing Card to order everyday goods and services, such as office and
industrial supplies and equipment and computer hardware and software, directly
from manufacturers and suppliers, rather than using the traditional system of
requisitions, purchase orders and invoices and retail store purchasing. CSG pays
the suppliers and submits a single monthly billing statement to the company.

      The success of the Purchasing Card has helped CSG reduce its dependence on
travel and entertainment spending, which has decreased from 85 percent of total
billings in 1995 to 70 percent in 2001. This change in mix helped soften the
impact on CSG of a difficult year in corporate spending. In 2001, TRS signed
ADP, Delta Air Lines and BP, among others as Corporate Purchasing Card clients.
TRS also announced a collaborative effort with Oracle to ensure interoperability
between the Corporate Purchasing Card platform and Oracle's iProcurement
solution.

      Competition in the commercial card (corporate card and corporate
purchasing card) business is increasingly intense at both the card network and
card issuer levels. At the network level, Diners Club remains a significant
global competitor. In addition, both VISA and MasterCard have stepped up efforts
to support card issuers such as U.S. Bank, JP Morgan Chase, GE Financial
Services, and Citibank (in the U.S. and globally), who are willing to build and
support data collection and reporting necessary to satisfy customer
requirements. MasterCard has recently announced enhanced web-based support for
its corporate card issuing members. During the past year, VISA International
supported the creation of a joint venture by a number of its member banks from
around the world to compete against CSG and Diners Club for the business of
multinational companies. The key competitive factors in the commercial card
business are (i) the ability to capture and deliver detailed transaction data
and expense management reports; (ii) the number and types of businesses that
accept the cards; (iii) pricing; (iv) the range and innovativeness of products
and services to suit business needs; (v) quality of customer services and (vi)
global presence. For a discussion of competition relating to the Card issuing
business, see page 7.

      CSG integrates the Corporate Card and business travel services in the
United States and certain foreign countries to compete for the business traveler
and to provide client companies with a customized approach to managing their
travel and entertainment budgets. Clients are provided an information package to
plan, account for and control travel and entertainment expenses.

                                                                              11


      CSG provides a wide variety of travel services to customers traveling for
business and is one of the leading business travel providers worldwide. For
business travel accounts, CSG provides corporate travel policy consultation and
management information systems, and group and incentive travel services.

      CSG faces vigorous competition in the United States and abroad from
numerous other travel agencies as well as direct sales by airlines and travel
suppliers. In June 2001, five of the largest U.S. carriers launched Orbitz, an
online travel agency from which travelers are able to have access to information
regarding a large selection of airfares from many airlines, including web-only
fares, which may in some cases be lower than fares that can be obtained through
traditional travel agencies. The website also provides offers on lodging, car
rentals and other travel. While Orbitz is targeted primarily toward the leisure
traveler, business travelers are increasingly using Orbitz and other
airline-owned websites to gain access to web-only fares. Competition among
travel agencies is mainly based on price, service, convenience and proximity to
the customer and has increased due to several factors in recent years, including
the acquisition of independent agencies by larger travel companies. In addition,
competition comes from corporate customers themselves as many companies have
become accredited as in-house corporate travel agents.

      Airlines have continued efforts to reduce their distribution expenses,
including travel agency commissions. For example, in March 2002, several of the
major U.S. airlines announced that they will no longer pay any "base"
commissions to travel agents for tickets sold in the U.S. and Canada for all
domestic and international travel. In addition, airlines have begun efforts to
move corporate customers to their own proprietary direct billing and payment
products, such as UATP. In addition, airlines continue to consolidate through
mergers and by forming alliances for marketing and service delivery purposes.
Those actions have caused some independent travel agencies to go out of business
and, as referenced above, forced others to seek consolidation opportunities.
Consolidation of travel agencies is likely to continue as agencies seek to
better serve national and multinational business travel clients and negotiate
more effectively with the airlines. It is also expected that travel agencies
will continue to look for expense reduction opportunities such as focusing on
electronic ticketing. Customers may increasingly seek alternative channels to
make travel arrangements, such as online travel reservation services like Orbitz
or airline services that require booking directly with the airlines.

      CSG has historically received commissions and fees for travel bookings and
arrangements from airlines, hotels, car rental companies and other travel
suppliers, fees for reservations and ticketing and management and transaction
fees from certain business travel accounts. The ongoing trend of airline
alliances, airline websites permitting travelers to book business directly and
airline commission rate reductions continues to result in decreased business
travel revenue for travel companies and price increases for travelers, fewer
opportunities for data aggregation for corporations and greater pressure on the
CSG travel business. CSG continues to modify its business model to address these
ongoing industry challenges. For example, CSG has been successful in its efforts
to rely less on commission revenues from suppliers, such as airlines or hotels,
and now relies more on customers to pay transaction fees for its travel
services. In 2001, only 30 percent of corporate travel revenues came from
airlines, hotels, rental car companies and other suppliers and 70 percent came
from customers. A few years ago, the mix was approximately the reverse.

      These changes to CSG's sources of revenue enabled Corporate Travel to
successfully manage its business in one of the toughest years in recent history
for the business travel industry. In 2001, Corporate Travel was profitable,
although there were challenging economic conditions in many markets and downward
pressure on profit margins that continued throughout the travel industry. These
trends were exacerbated by the events of September 11, 2001, which severely
affected business and leisure travel. Corporate Travel took advantage of the
downturn in travel to step up sales efforts. It finished the year with an
impressive list of new travel clients, including Aventis in the United States,
Jaguar Cars Limited

                                                                              12


and Land Rover UK in the United Kingdom, Ford in Latin America, Philips in
Taiwan, and Pepsico Europe and Xerox in Europe. Worldwide, TRS now handles
corporate travel for more than 50,000 companies.

      As in other areas of the Company, CSG has moved many of its business
processes and customer servicing online to reduce costs, improve processes and
enhance the quality of customer service. The percentage of corporate travel
reservations processed online in 2001 increased fivefold. This shift lowered
TRS' costs while providing clients with faster, better service. Similarly, two
years after its launch in the United States, American Express @ Work'r' now
handles more than half of the Company's commercial card maintenance transactions
online. This service automates the daily administrative tasks clients perform to
manage their card programs. It allows corporate clients to apply for Corporate
Cards using fully automated systems and enables Corporate Card program
administrators to instantly approve or cancel cards, update contact information,
or adjust spending limits. More than 86 percent of Corporate Card clients are
enrolled in American Express @ Work.

      CSG has also developed relationships with a number of leading e-commerce
firms to provide a faster, more efficient way for customers to purchase office
supplies and related products using the Corporate Purchasing Card. For example,
CSG has a strategic agreement with Ariba, Inc. to accelerate and streamline
business-to-business commerce through the integration of CSG payment services
with Ariba's procurement technology. With GetThere, CSG introduced a web-based
corporate travel booking system, Corporate Travel Online. CSG also entered into
a joint venture to form a new company, MarketMile LLC, which operates an
Internet-based marketplace to streamline the purchasing of everyday business
products and services for mid-sized firms. CSG also formed Workadia, an online
intranet work environment for the employees of mid-sized and larger firms. In
March 2002, CSG announced that it has entered into an agreement with IBM to
jointly develop a Web-based expense reporting and reconciliation tool designed
to reduce the cost of managing everyday business expenses. Under the agreement,
CSG plans to market the application as part of its American Express @ Work suite
of online expense management tools.

      TRS INTERNATIONAL

      TRS' Card, travel and merchant businesses conducted outside the U.S. and
certain other services are included in TRS International. TRS International
continues to focus on expanding its proprietary card business and network
alliances in key markets, expanding the network of merchants that accept
American Express Cards, and leveraging opportunities for growth in Corporate
Card, Corporate Travel and in other areas of Corporate Services. This business
was strengthened in 2001 through new product introductions and new Global
Network Services' agreements.

      During 2001, TRS International had strong increases in total
cards-in-force and lending balances. TRS International continued to bolster
its proprietary business during the year through the launch of proprietary
charge and credit products in 14 countries, 41 affinity card products and 30
distribution agreements. TRS is also seeing strong results from its
partnership with British Airways, which led to the 2001 launch of three new
cobrand credit cards for British Airways UK Executive Club members. TRS also
introduced cobrand cards with Indian Airlines, Accor in Germany and a small
business card with Australia's Westpac Bank; and Blue from American Express in
Australia, Austria, France and Germany.

      During the year, TRS International also continued to pursue alliances
through joint ventures or other agreements with qualified institutions that
issue cards with an American Express logo. See Global Network Services on page 2
for a discussion of these alliances. TRS expects to continue establishing
similar types of arrangements outside the United States, while at the same time
deepening its existing relationships. During 2001, TRS substantially completed
the implementation of its agreement with JCB Co., Ltd. (Japan Credit Bureau),
the largest card issuer and merchant acquirer in Japan, whereby TRS will become
the merchant acquirer for JCB cards in Australia, Canada, India, Mexico, and New
Zealand. TRS also completed the first phase of implementing the agreement under
which JCB will become a third party merchant acquirer for TRS in Japan. As a
result of this implementation, approximately 340,000 additional merchants in
Japan began accepting the Card in September, 2001, significantly expanding the
extent of American Express merchant coverage in the country.


      As a result of the expansion of the types of merchants accepting charge
and credit cards, and the utilization of a more discriminating approach to
identify inactive merchant accounts, in 2001, TRS revised its calculation of
international merchant coverage. Based on this revision, TRS' international
merchant coverage now accommodates approximately 85.4 percent of Cardmembers'
general purpose plastic spending, up from approximately 84.4 percent a year
ago. TRS continued to make good progress in signing key merchants and merchants
in new industry categories, including quick-service restaurants, government,
utilities and telecommunications. New signings included Arrow Pharmaceuticals
in France and Singapore Telecom.

      In recent years there has been considerable interest on the part of a
number of government regulators around the world in the fees which merchants are
charged to accept credit cards. Most significantly, regulators in the European
Union and Australia have conducted extensive investigations



<Page>

                                                                              13


into the way that VISA and MasterCard members collectively set the
"interchange", which is the fee paid to the card issuing bank and the
fundamental element of merchant pricing, and are imposing regulations on this
process. Regulators in both jurisdictions have also considered the industry
practice of prohibiting merchants from passing these fees along to consumers
through surcharges on credit card purchases. Although the regulatory focus has
been specifically on VISA and MasterCard, government regulation of the card
associations' pricing could ultimately affect all card service providers. In
addition, any legal or regulatory bar on the "no surcharging" rules may result
in merchant surcharging to consumers who choose to pay with credit and charge
cards.

      As in the United States, suppression of Card acceptance continues to be a
major area of focus.

      In 2001 the Online Merchant Service program, which enables merchants to
check and update their account information on the Internet, was launched in
Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Singapore. A
streamlined merchant contracting process was also implemented in most European
markets, which enables merchants to begin accepting the Card more quickly. In
addition, TRS International continued to work with merchant customers on ways to
reduce the risk of Cardmember fraud.

      TRS also had success in 2001 in expanding its Corporate card client base
in international markets. In addition, in 2002 the Company partnered with China
International Travel Services in announcing the first Sino-U.S. corporate travel
joint venture in the People's Republic of China. TRS also announced a Corporate
Travel joint venture in Italy -- UVET American Express Corporate Travel. At its
launch, the company was the largest corporate travel agency in Italy. TRS also
introduced its Corporate Purchasing Card in a number of key international
markets, signing on as clients Pfizer in the United Kingdom, Nortel Networks
in Latin America and Dupont in Singapore and Hong Kong. In 2001, American
Express @ Work also expanded internationally and is now offered to companies
in 20 countries.

      TRAVELERS CHEQUE

      The Company, through its Travelers Cheque Group, is a leading issuer of
travelers checks. The Company also issues Money Order and Official Check
products in the United States, and the TravelFunds Direct'r' product, which
provides direct delivery of foreign bank notes and Travelers Cheques in selected
markets.

      The American Express'r' Travelers Cheque ("Travelers Cheque" or "Cheque")
is sold as a safe and convenient alternative to currency. The Travelers Cheque
is a negotiable instrument, has no expiration date and is payable by the issuer
in the currency of issuance when presented for the purchase of goods and
services or for redemption. Gift Cheques, a type of Travelers Cheque, are used
for gift-giving purposes.

      Travelers Cheques are issued in eight currencies, including a
Euro-denominated Travelers Cheque, both directly by the Company and through
joint venture companies in which the Company generally holds an equity interest.
As a result of the final conversion in early 2002 of certain European currencies
to the Euro, the Company ceased selling the French Franc, German Mark and Dutch
Guilder Travelers Cheques as of the end of 2001. However, the Company will
continue to honor, redeem, and refund the Cheques, since they do not expire.

      American Express Travelers Cheques are sold through a broad network of
selling outlets worldwide, including travel offices of the Company, its
affiliates and representatives, travel agents, commercial banks, savings banks,
savings and loan associations, credit unions and other financial, travel and
commercial businesses. The Company sometimes compensates selling outlets for
their sale of Travelers Cheques. In 2001, the Company's sale of Travelers
Cheques and Gift Cheques over the Internet continued to grow strongly. During
the year, overall Travelers Cheque sales decreased 7.3 percent globally, and
consumer Gift Cheque sales increased approximately 13 percent. While Gift Cheque
growth can be attributed to new advertising and marketing programs, it is
believed that the lag in Travelers Cheque sales was driven by the global
economic slowdown and the reduction in both business and personal travel, both
before and after the events of September 11.

      Partnerships with sellers continue to be critical to the Travelers Cheque
Group as TRS expands its sales distribution network. For example, in 2001,
following Citicorp Services, Inc.'s decision to exit the travelers check issuing
business, Citicorp agreed to assist TRS in efforts to transition the
distribution of American Express Travelers Cheques to Citicorp travelers check
sellers, including Citibank branches. As a result, TRS achieved new seller
signings representing the largest volume of new sales in the history of TRS'
Travelers Cheques business. TRS also entered into agreements with HSBC, which
began selling TRS' products globally in early 2002, U.S. Bancorp, Australia
Post and Rabobank in the Netherlands. With the recent addition of JTB and
Nippon Travel Agency, Japan's top five travel agents now sell American Express
Travelers Cheques.

      The proceeds from sales of Travelers Cheques issued by the Company are
invested predominantly in highly-rated debt securities consisting primarily of
intermediate- and long-term state and municipal obligations.

                                                                              15


      Issuers of travelers checks and money orders are regulated under most
states' "money transmitter" laws. These laws require travelers check issuers to
obtain licenses, to meet certain safety and soundness criteria, to hold
outstanding proceeds of sale in highly rated and secure investments, and to
provide detailed reports. Many states audit Travelers Cheque and Money Order
licensees annually. In addition, Travelers Cheque and Money Order issuers are
required to comply with state unclaimed and abandoned property laws. These laws
require issuers to pay to states the face amount of any Travelers Cheque or
Money Order that is uncashed or unredeemed after a specified period of years. On
December 31, 2001, new federal anti-money laundering regulations became
effective. These regulations required, among other things, the registration of
traveler check and money order issuers as "Money Service Businesses" and
compliance with anti-money laundering recording and reporting requirements by
issuers and selling outlets. For a discussion of other anti-money laundering
legislative initiatives affecting the Travelers Cheque Group, see page 34
under the heading "Corporate and Other."

      Travelers Cheques compete with a wide variety of financial payment
products. Consumers may choose to use their credit or charge cards when
they travel instead of carrying Travelers Cheques, although a Travelers Cheque
would not typically be an acceptable substitute for most transactions made
with credit or charge cards. Other payment mechanisms that might substitute
for Travelers Cheques include cash, checks, other brands of travelers checks,
debit cards and cards accepted at national and international automated teller
machine networks. The principal competitive factors affecting the travelers
check industry are (i) the availability to the consumer of other forms of
payment; (ii) the amount of the fee charged to the consumer; (iii) the
availability and acceptability of travelers checks throughout the world;
(iv) the compensation paid to, and frequency of settlement by, selling outlets;
(v) the accessibility of travelers check sales and refunds; (vi) the success
of marketing and promotional campaigns; and (vii) the ability to service the
check purchaser satisfactorily if the checks are lost or stolen.

                       AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS

      The Company, through its American Express Financial Advisors business unit
("AEFA"), makes available a variety of financial products and services to help
individuals, businesses and institutions establish and achieve their financial
goals. This business unit includes American Express Financial Corporation
("AEFC") and its subsidiaries and affiliates described below. At December 31,
2001 AEFA maintained a nationwide field sales force of over 11,000 persons (as
compared to over 12,000 in 2000), which provided products and services to more
than 2.0 million clients throughout the U.S.

      The core of AEFA's business is financial planning and advice. AEFA's
financial advisors work with retail clients to develop strong relationships and
long-term financial strategies. To fulfill the needs of its retail clients, AEFA
also develops and offers a broad array of financial products and services,
including insurance and annuities, a variety of investment products, including
investment certificates, mutual funds and limited partnerships, Section 529
college savings plans, personal trust services and retail securities brokerage,
including online direct brokerage services.

      AEFA believes that its ability to provide broad-based products and
services on a relationship basis is a competitive advantage. Unlike many of
AEFA's competitors, whose field forces typically comprise brokers who focus on
completing transactions, many of AEFA's advisors are Certified Financial
Planners who work closely with clients to develop long-term financial plans. As
a result, AEFA has a client retention rate of 94 percent, and in 2001 its
redemption rates continued to compare favorably with industry levels, even in
light of the difficult environment AEFA faced during the year.

      AEFA continues to invest considerably in developing tools and training for
its advisors to strengthen their ability to offer solid advice and financial
plans. During 2001, nearly 44 percent of new retail clients had a financial plan
developed for them by an AEFA advisor. As has been the case historically,
clients with plans tend to buy more products. In 2001, product sales generated
through financial planning and advice services were 73 percent of total advisor
sales, compared with 68 percent during the prior year.

      AEFA also offers products and services directly to institutions, such as
asset management, institutional trust and employee benefit plan administration,
as well as certain products through third-party financial institutions.

                                                                              17


      In recent years, as AEFA has expanded its distribution channels, it has
also increased its sale of non-proprietary products, particularly mutual funds,
to meet the demands of clients for more competitive investment products. A
significant portion of AEFA's non-proprietary mutual fund sales are made in
connection with wrap programs where clients pay AEFA a fee that is typically a
percentage of assets under management, and which are more profitable than the
sale of non-proprietary products alone. The sales of non-proprietary products on
a stand-alone basis generally are much less profitable than proprietary sales.
As discussed below, one of AEFA's key priorities is improving the performance of
its proprietary investment products.

      In 2001, AEFA took various steps to address certain major components of
its business.

            o     It rebalanced its investment portfolio toward higher quality,
                  less volatile holdings and reduced the concentration of credit
                  exposure to individual companies and industry sectors. For a
                  further discussion of these issues and certain losses in
                  AEFA's high-yield portfolio, see pages 28 through 29 and pages
                  41 through 44 under the caption "Financial Review," and Note 4
                  on pages 54 through 57, of the Company's 2001 Annual Report to
                  Shareholders, which portions of such report are incorporated
                  herein by reference.

            o     It refined the organizational structure for its field sales
                  force, which is described below under "Distribution of
                  Products and Services."

            o     It took various actions to improve its asset management
                  capability and investment performance to increase the
                  competitiveness of its proprietary products, including:

                  -     Launching six new mutual funds that are sub-advised by
                        leading asset managers; and

                  -     Increasing the strength and depth of its investment
                        talent, including the hiring of a new Chief Investment
                        Officer and head of risk management, the appointment of
                        a new research director, and in early 2002, the hiring
                        of several experienced portfolio managers with strong
                        track records.

      DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

      AEFA has three primary financial service distribution channels: retail,
consisting of financial advisors and direct access (online, telephone and mail),
institutional and third party.

      AEFA's primary distribution channel is its sales force of financial
advisors. Through this channel, AEFA offers financial planning and investment
advisory services (for which it charges a fee) to individuals and business
owners which may address six basic areas of financial planning: financial
position, protection, investment, income tax, retirement and estate planning.
AEFA's financial advisors provide clients with recommendations from more than
3,500 proprietary and non-proprietary products and services.

      AEFA's organizational structure provides advisors choices in how they
affiliate with the organization, with various levels of service, compensation
and branding. Advisors are able to choose an employee advisor platform, with
compensation being paid as a draw against commissions, with a high level of
support and a lower payout rate; a branded advisor platform, structured as a
franchise system, in which advisors get a higher payout rate and can purchase
the support services they prefer; or an affiliated but unbranded broker-dealer
platform with a yet higher payout. The unbranded platform is Securities America,
Inc., a broker-dealer owned by AEFC. It services approximately 1,330 financial
advisors and is a distributor of mutual funds, annuities and insurance products.



<Page>

                                                                              18


      Approximately 25 percent of AEFA's financial advisors are American Express
employees; about 65 percent are American Express-branded franchisees; and about
10 percent are in the unbranded platform. AEFA believes it is the only U.S.
company to offer these three different career tracks for advisors, which it
considers a strategic advantage. During 2001, AEFA streamlined its field
organization from 44 to 32 markets, eliminating overhead and better aligning
resources. As part of its platform restructuring and in light of market
conditions, AEFA reduced its employee advisors by 20 percent and tightened its
hiring criteria so that it more effectively selects those applicants with the
highest chance of success. At the same time, AEFA strengthened its relationship
with its branded independent contractor advisors. Due in part to these measures,
the retention rate for veteran advisors reached an all-time high in 2001.

      AEFA believes that it needs to continue its efforts to increase the size
of its dedicated field force due to its main competitors' larger sales forces
and more developed alternative distribution channels. In attracting and
retaining members of the field force, AEFA competes with financial planning
firms, insurance companies, securities broker-dealers and other financial
institutions.

      Consistent with the Company's goal of promoting cross selling across all
of its units, AEFA has increased its sales to customers from other American
Express businesses. In 2001, approximately 30 percent of all new clients of
AEFA's financial advisors were already Cardmembers, and significant hedge fund
and investment certificate sales were made to American Express Bank's foreign
customers.

      AEFA has taken steps to integrate its direct retail distribution channel
with the advisor channel. AEFA's online brokerage business, American Express
Brokerage, allows clients to purchase and sell securities online, obtain
research and information about a wide variety of securities, use asset
allocation and financial planning tools, contact an advisor, as well as have
access to more than 3,000 proprietary and non-proprietary mutual funds, among
other services.

      In January 2001, the Company acquired Sharepeople Group plc, an online
brokerage business in Europe. The new wholly-owned subsidiary is being marketed
as American Express Sharepeople. The firm offers customers trading in U.K. and
U.S. equities, as well as unit trust products. Following the acquisition of
Sharepeople Group, the Company formed the Global Brokerage and Membership
B@nking ("GBMB") unit to help coordinate the expansion of its financial services
businesses globally. This unit includes the Company's U.S. brokerage services
offered through AEFA, Sharepeople Group and Membership B@nking. GBMB works
closely with AEFA and TRS' card business in both the United States and select
international markets to better reach consumers through a number of distribution
channels with a variety of products.

      The Internet has proven to be an important and cost effective tool for
acquiring new customers. The number of advisor leads generated via the Internet
increased significantly in 2001, at a substantially reduced cost versus
alternative channels. Additionally, the Internet has emerged as a significant
channel for service on the institutional and retail sides of the business. AEFA
experienced dramatic growth in online account inquiries and transactions in
2001.

      In order to provide retail clients with a more integrated service, it
will be necessary to build the capability to recognize and service the
client's entire relationship with AEFA, regardless of which channel or
channels they have used. This will require, among other things, continued
investment in both technology infrastructure and the service organization.

                                                                              19


      During the year, AEFA continued to expand the scope of its institutional
business, which includes separate account asset management, administrative and
other services for corporate, public and union retirement funds. AEFA continued
to acquire retail clients through the workplace with its Financial Education and
Planning Services, which now includes 401(k) education, investor education and
after-tax investments. Financial Education and Planning Services serves
employees at approximately 320 regional and national companies and plans to grow
through sales to both new clients and current American Express Retirement
Services clients.

      In addition to the retail and institutional distribution channels, AEFA
traditionally has had a third-party channel that distributes proprietary
investment, insurance and annuity products through insurance agencies and
broker-dealers who may also be associated with financial institutions, such as
banks, as well as AEFA's affiliated broker-dealer, Securities America, Inc. In
2001, AEFA expanded its network of third-party distributors and its range of
products offered through them, resulting in strong third-party sales efforts.
During 2001, AEFA's third-party broker-dealer channel focused on its strategic
alliance relationships with national and regional banks.

      In 2001, AEFA continued to expand its securities brokerage services.
American Enterprise Investment Services Inc. ("AEIS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of AEFC, provides securities execution and clearance services for approximately
827,000 retail and institutional clients of AEFA. AEIS holds over $41.9 billion
in assets for clients. AEIS is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC, is a
member of the NASD and the Chicago Stock Exchange and is registered with
appropriate states.

      American Express Financial Advisors Inc. ("AXP Advisors"), AEFC's
principal marketing subsidiary, does business as a broker-dealer and investment
advisor in all 50 states, the District of Columbia. AXP Advisors is also
registered in Puerto Rico. AXP Advisors is registered as a broker-dealer and
investment advisor regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
("NASD"). AEFA's financial advisors must obtain all required state and NASD
licenses.

      AEFA has experienced, and believes it will continue to be subject to,
increased regulatory oversight of the securities and commodities industries at
all levels. Among other powers, the SEC, self-regulatory organizations and state
securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings, which may result
in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension or
expulsion of a broker-dealer or an investment advisor and its officers or
employees. In addition, individual investors can bring complaints against AEFA.
AEFA also believes it is one of the first financial institutions to structure
itself as a franchise system. As such, AEFA is subject to Federal Trade
Commission and state franchise requirements.

      Competition in the financial services industry focuses primarily on cost,
investment performance, yield, convenience, service, reliability, safety,
innovation, distribution systems, reputation and brand recognition. Competition
in this industry is very intense. AEFA competes with a variety of financial
institutions such as banks, securities brokers, mutual funds and insurance
companies. Some of these institutions are larger and more global than AEFA, and
the continuing trend towards consolidation and globalization in the financial
services industry may increase the number of these stronger competitors. Many of
these financial institutions also have products and services that increasingly
cross over the traditional lines that previously differentiated one type of
institution from another, thereby heightening competition for AEFA. The ability
of certain financial institutions to offer, and the dramatically increased usage
by investors of, online investment and information services has also affected
the competitive landscape over the past few years. Reflecting the competitive
environment, certain financial institutions have continued to seek to hire
AEFA's financial advisors. AEFA believes that competition in this industry has
increased as a result of the implementation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial

                                                                              20


Services Modernization Act of 1999 ("Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act"), which permits
banks, insurance companies and securities firms to combine and offer a broad
range of permissible financial services. See page 34 for a discussion of
privacy-related issues under this law.

      AEFA's business does not, as a whole, experience significant seasonal
fluctuations.

      INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES

      AEFA's insurance business is carried on primarily by IDS Life Insurance
Company ("IDS Life"), a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of
the State of Minnesota. IDS Life is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEFC and serves
all states except New York. IDS Life believes it is the fifteenth largest life
insurance company in the United States, with consolidated assets at December 31,
2001 of approximately $58 billion (under generally accepted accounting
principles). IDS Life Insurance Company of New York is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of IDS Life and serves New York State residents. IDS Life also owns American
Enterprise Life Insurance Company ("American Enterprise Life"), which issues
fixed and variable annuity contracts for sale through insurance agencies and
broker-dealers who may also be associated with financial institutions, such as
banks. American Centurion Life Assurance Company ("American Centurion Life"),
is an IDS Life subsidiary that offers fixed and variable annuities to American
Express Cardmembers and others in New York, as well as fixed and variable
annuities for sale through insurance agencies and broker-dealers who may also be
associated with financial institutions, such as banks, in New York. IDS Life
owns American Partners Life Insurance Company ("American Partners Life"), which
offers fixed and variable annuity contracts to American Express Cardmembers and
others who reside in states other than New York.

      IDS Life's products include the four basic types of life insurance:
(1) whole life, (2) universal life, (3) variable and (4) term products
(including waiver of premium and accidental death benefits), as well as
disability income and long-term care insurance. IDS Life offers a single
premium life product that provides a death benefit to the policy beneficiary
based on a single premium deposit. IDS Life offers variable universal life
insurance products, including American Express'r' Variable Universal Life III
and American Express Succession Select'sm' Variable Universal Life Insurance.

      Variable universal life combines the features of universal life and an
investment account. Specifically, variable universal life provides permanent,
cash value insurance with flexible premiums, separate cash value investment
accounts, a fixed account and death benefit options. The policyholder can decide
how to allocate premiums/cash value among the fixed and variable investment
options. American Express Succession Select'sm' is a second to die product
meaning that two lives are insured rather than one, and the policy proceeds
are paid upon the death of both insureds.

      IDS Life is one of the largest issuers in the U.S. of single premium and
flexible premium deferred annuities on both a fixed and variable basis.
Immediate annuities are offered as well. IDS Life's fixed deferred annuities
guarantee a relatively low annual interest rate during the accumulation period
(the time before annuity payments begin). However, the company has the option of
paying a higher rate set at its discretion. In addition, persons owning one type
of annuity may have their interest calculated based on any movement in a
broad-based stock market index. IDS Life also offers variable annuities, the
American Express Retirement Advisor Advantage'sm' Variable Annuity and the
American Express Retirement Advisor Select Variable Annuity'sm'.

      Under IDS Life's variable life insurance and variable annuity products
described above, the purchaser may choose among a fixed investment option that
includes IDS Life's "general account" as well as from a variety of variable
investment options, which include portfolios that invest in common stocks,
bonds, managed assets and/or short term securities. The purchaser assumes the
investment performance risk and reward of the variable options selected. IDS
Life serves as the investment manager and AEFC serves as the investment advisor
of seven portfolios underlying the variable life insurance products and of
nineteen portfolios underlying both the variable life insurance and variable
annuity products. The investment options also include many portfolios managed
by firms other than IDS Life or its subsidiaries.

      Although over the past several years IDS Life's variable annuity sales
have had an increasing impact on total annuity sales, in 2001, sales of all
annuity products declined four percent over the prior year.

      For its general account, IDS Life primarily invests in fixed income
securities over a broad range of maturities for the purpose of providing fixed
annuity clients with a rate of return on their investments while controlling
risk, and to provide a dependable and targeted spread between the interest rate
earned on investments and the interest rate credited to contractholders'
accounts. IDS Life does not invest in securities to generate trading profits.

      IDS Life has an investment committee that holds regularly scheduled
meetings and, when necessary, special meetings. At these meetings, the committee
reviews models projecting different interest rate scenarios, risk/return
measures, and their effect on profitability. The objective of the committee is
to structure the investment security portfolio based upon the type of behavior
of products in the liability portfolio so as to achieve targeted levels of
profitability within defined risk parameters and to meet contractual
obligations.

      Rates credited to contractholders' accounts are generally reset at shorter
intervals than the maturity of underlying investments. Therefore, margins may be
negatively impacted by increases in the general level of interest rates. Part of
the committee's strategy includes the use of derivatives, such as interest rate
caps, swaps and floors, for risk management purposes. These derivatives help
protect margins by increasing investment returns if there is a sudden and
severe rise in interest rates, thereby mitigating the impact of an increase in
rates credited to contractholders' accounts.

      IDS Life receives ratings from independent rating agencies. These agencies
evaluate the financial soundness and claims-paying ability of insurance
companies based on a number of different factors. This information does not
relate to the management or performance of the variable accounts of the
contract. This information relates only to the fixed account and reflects the
ability to make annuity payouts and to pay death benefits and other
distributions from the contract.

      Ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in IDS Life and
its ability to market its annuity and life insurance products. Rating agencies
continually review the financial performance and condition of insurers,
including IDS Life. Lowering of the IDS Life ratings could have a material
adverse effect on IDS Life's ability to market its products and could increase
the surrender of IDS Life's products. IDS Life is rated "A+" (Superior) by A.M.
Best Company, Inc. and its claims-paying ability/financial strength is rated
"Aa3" (Excellent) by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's), and "AA" (Very
Strong) by Fitch.

      The foregoing ratings reflect each rating agency's opinion of IDS Life's
financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet its obligations to
policyholders and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of
investors. Such factors are of concern to policyholders, agents and

      IDS Life, American Enterprise Life and American Partners Life are subject
to comprehensive regulation by the Minnesota Department of Commerce (Insurance
Division), the Indiana Department of Insurance, and the Arizona Department of
Insurance, respectively. American Centurion Life and IDS Life Insurance Company
of New York are regulated by the New York State Department of Insurance. The
laws of the other states in which these companies do business also regulate such
matters as the licensing of sales personnel and, in some cases, the marketing
and contents of insurance policies and annuity contracts. The purpose of such
regulation and supervision is primarily to protect the interests of
policyholders.

      Regulatory scrutiny of market conduct practices of insurance companies,
including sales, marketing and replacements of fixed and variable life insurance
and annuities and "bonus" annuities, has increased significantly in recent years
and is affecting the manner in which companies approach various operational
issues, including compliance. The number of private lawsuits alleging violations
of laws in connection with insurance and annuity market conduct has increased
(see Legal Proceedings on page 42). Virtually all states mandate participation
in insurance guaranty associations, which assess insurance companies in order to
fund claims of policyholders of insolvent insurance companies. On the federal
level, there is periodic interest in enacting new regulations relating to
various aspects of the insurance industry, including taxation of variable
annuities and life insurance policies, accounting procedures, as well as the
treatment of persons differently because of gender, with respect to terms,
conditions, rates or benefits of an insurance contract. New federal regulation
in any of these areas could potentially have an adverse effect upon AEFC's
insurance subsidiaries.

      As a distributor of variable annuity and life insurance contracts, IDS
Life is registered as a broker-dealer and is a member of the NASD. As investment
manager of various investment companies, IDS Life is registered as an investment
advisor under applicable federal requirements.

      IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company ("IDS Property Casualty") provides
personal auto and homeowner's coverage to clients in 36 states and the District
of Columbia. This insurance is also underwritten by AMEX Assurance Company, a
subsidiary of American Express Company, and reinsured by IDS Property Casualty.
IDS Property Casualty is regulated by the Commissioner of Insurance for
Wisconsin. AMEX Assurance Company, which also provides certain American Express
Card related insurance products, is regulated by the Commissioner of Insurance
for Illinois. IDS Property Casualty also signed a new partnership with Costco
which offers IDS Property Casualty's auto and homeowner's insurance to Costco
members in 23 states.

      The insurance and annuity business is highly competitive, and IDS Life's
competitors consist of both stock and mutual insurance companies. Competitive
factors applicable to the insurance business include product features, the
interest rates credited to products, the charges deducted from the cash values
of such products, investment performance, the financial strength of the
organization, claims paying ratings and the services provided to policyholders.

      INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES

      American Express Certificate Company ("AECC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of AEFC, issues face-amount investment certificates. AECC is registered as an
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. AECC currently
issues ten types of face-amount certificates. Owners of AECC certificates are
entitled to receive, at maturity, a stated amount of money equal to the
aggregate investments in the certificate plus interest at rates declared from
time to time by AECC. In addition, persons owning three types of certificates
may have their interest calculated in whole or in part based on any upward
movement in a broad-based stock market index up to a variable maximum return.
The certificates issued by AECC are not insured by any government agency. AEFC
acts as investment manager for AECC. Certificates are sold by AEFA's field
force.

                                                                              22


      AECC is the largest issuer of face-amount certificates in the United
States. At December 31, 2001, it had approximately $4.6 billion in assets.
AECC's certificates compete with many other investments offered by banks,
savings and loan associations, credit unions, mutual funds, insurance companies
and similar financial institutions, which may be viewed by potential customers
as offering a comparable or superior combination of safety and return on
investment.

      MUTUAL FUNDS

      AEFA offers a variety of mutual funds, for which AXP Advisors acts as
principal underwriter (distributor of shares). AEFC acts as investment manager
and performs various administrative services. The American Express'r' Funds
consist of 53 retail mutual funds, with varied investment objectives and
include, for example, money market, tax-exempt, bond and stock funds. The
American Express Funds, with combined net assets at December 31, 2001 of $79.9
billion, was the 27th largest mutual fund family in the United States and,
excluding money market funds, was the 13th largest.

      For most funds, shares are sold in four classes. Class A shares are sold
at net asset value plus any applicable sales charge. The maximum sales charge is
5.75 percent for equity funds and 4.75 percent for income funds, with reduced
sales charges for larger purchases. The sales charge may be waived for certain
purchases, including those made through an investment product sponsored by AXP
Advisors or another authorized financial intermediary. Class B shares are sold
with a rear load. The maximum deferred sales charge is five percent, declining
to no charge for shares held over six years. Class C shares do not have a
front-end sales charge. A one percent contingent deferred sales charge may apply
for shares sold less than one year after purchase. Class Y shares are primarily
sold to institutional clients with no load. There are five index funds, which
are sold in two no-load classes. Class D shares are sold with a 0.25 percent fee
for distribution services, but without a sales charge, through an investment
product sponsored by AEFA or another authorized financial institution. Class E
shares are sold without a sales or distribution fee through American Express
brokerage accounts and qualifying institutional accounts.

      Fifteen of the American Express Funds are structured as feeder funds
investing in the Preferred Master Trust Group, a group of 15 master funds,
advised by AEFC. This feeder structure provides for potential development of
additional channels of distribution.

      In addition to full-commission and discount brokerage firms, competitors
include other financial institutions, such as banks and insurance companies.
Recent growth trends in the market over the last several years, including the
increased demand for mutual funds by retail investors, have expanded the number
of competitors in the industry. Some competitors are larger, more diversified
and offer a greater number of products, and may have an advantage in their
ability to attract and retain customers on the basis of one-stop shopping. The
competitive factors affecting the sale of mutual funds include sales charges
("loads") paid, administrative expenses, services received, the ability to
attract and retain a network of third-party distributors, investment
performance, fund ratings issued by third-parties such as Morningstar, the
variety of products and services offered, the convenience to the investor,
advertising and promotion campaigns, and general market conditions. The funds
compete with other investment products, including funds that have no sales
charge (i.e., "no load" funds) and funds distributed through independent
brokerage firms.

      OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

      American Express Asset Management Group Inc. ("AEAMG"), a subsidiary of
AEFC and an SEC registered investment adviser, directly or through operating
divisions or subsidiaries, provides investment management services to:

      o     Pension, profit-sharing, employee savings and endowment funds of
            large and medium sized businesses, governmental units and other
            large institutional clients;

      o     Smaller accounts of wealthy individuals and small institutional
            clients, either directly to such clients or indirectly through wrap
            programs sponsored by various affiliated and unaffiliated entities;

      o     Various special purpose vehicles that issue their own securities
            (structured loan trusts) and which are collateralized by pools of
            assets (collateralized debt obligations); and,

      o     Various hedge funds structured as limited liability entities and
            offshore corporations.

      For its investment services, AEAMG generally receives fees which are
assessed on the basis of a percentage of the market value of assets under
management. Clients may also pay fees to AEAMG based on the performance of their
portfolio.

      AEAMG owns a 50.1 percent interest in Kenwood Capital Management LLC
("Kenwood") which provides investment management services to investment
companies, corporations, trusts, estates, charitable organizations and tax
qualified pension and profit sharing plans. (The remaining interest in Kenwood
is owned by two employees of AEAMG, who also manage certain AEFA-sponsored
mutual funds.) Kenwood employs an active investment strategy that is based on
a disciplined approach to stock selection and portfolio risk management, and
seeks to achieve consistent excess returns relative to passive index benchmarks
for small- and mid-cap segments of the United States equity market. AEAMG also
owns a 50.1 percent interest in Northwinds Marketing Group LLC ("Northwinds"), a
registered broker-dealer, which markets investment management services of AEAMG
and its affiliated investment advisers to large institutions, primarily union
and public pension funds. (The remaining interest in Northwinds is owned by a
limited liability company, the members of which are several former employees of
AEAMG.) AEAMG has guaranteed the level of certain commission revenue to
Northwinds through September 30, 2002.

      AEAMG provides investment management services to hedge funds structured as
limited liability entities and offshore corporations. AEAMG's direct or indirect
subsidiaries serve as general partner and investment manager of such entities.
These subsidiaries also serve as commodity pool operators for hedge funds that
trade in futures and, accordingly, are registered with the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission ("CFTC") and the National Futures Association. Other entities
affiliated with AEAMG, which are also subsidiaries of AEFC, jointly provide
investment management and advisory services to European equity hedge funds.
AEAMG receives an investment management fee, and may also receive a performance
fee, for the services it provides to the hedge funds. Portfolio managers for the
hedge funds, may from time to time, invest their own assets in the funds they
manage. Investors in the hedge funds include institutions, corporations, pension
plans, and high net worth individuals. Overall the business experienced
substantial growth in the number of hedge funds, adding twelve new funds (six
strategies), including fund of funds strategies. However, during 2001 two lead
portfolio managers for the U.S. equity funds were replaced. Subsequent to the
transition of these portfolio managers and continuing into the first quarter of
2002, the U.S. equity hedge funds experienced significant shrinkage resulting in
part from the return of investor assets in two of the hedge funds.

      AEAMG provides investment management services as collateral manager and,
from time to time, sponsors and provides marketing and distribution support to
various special purpose vehicles that issue

                                                                              24


securities which are collateralized by a pool of assets, i.e., collateralized
debt obligations ("CDO"). AEAMG also provides investment management services
to structured loan trusts. Typically, AEAMG or one or more of its affiliated
companies will invest its own money in such vehicles managed by AEAMG, including
in residual equity interests, which are the most subordinated (and accordingly,
riskiest and most volatile) interests in such vehicles; however, such
investments are expected to be less in the future than in recent years.

      AEAMG also serves as a sub-adviser to another subsidiary of AEFC with
respect to a U.S. equity portfolio which is part of an open-end unit trust under
Canadian tax law.

      At December 31, 2001, AEAMG managed securities portfolios in the U.S.
totaling $18.4 billion for 669 accounts.

      International investment management services are offered to domestic and
international institutional clients and mutual funds by other subsidiaries of
AEFC which have offices in London, Singapore and Tokyo. AEFA recently closed its
offices in Hong Kong. At December 31, 2001 these entities in the aggregate
managed securities portfolios totaling $8.4 billion for 61 accounts and $47
million for proprietary and non-proprietary mutual funds.

      The institutional investment management business is highly competitive and
AEAMG and its affiliates must compete against a substantial number of larger
firms in seeking to acquire and maintain assets under management. Competitive
factors in this business include fees, investment performance, including the
quality and "track record" of portfolio managers, global capabilities, range of
portfolios offered and client service.

      American Express Trust Company ("AETC") provides trustee, custodial,
record keeping and investment management services for pension, profit sharing,
401(k) and other qualified and non-qualified employee benefit plans. AETC is one
of the leading 401(k) service providers in the United States. AETC is trustee of
over 375 benefit plans which represent approximately $21.2 billion in assets and
1,135,000 participants. Competitive factors in this business include record
keeping and technological capabilities, investment performance and client
servicing. AETC also provides non-trusteed investment management of assets of
approximately $2.3 billion. AETC's institutional assets under custody are
approximately $117.4 billion. AETC is regulated by the Minnesota Department of
Commerce (Banking Division).

      American Express Personal Trust Services, FSB ("AEPTS") is a federal
savings bank regulated and supervised by the Office of Thrift Supervision (the
"OTS"). AEPTS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEFC and provides personal trust,
custodial, agency and investment management services to individual clients.
AEPTS is also registered with the SEC as an Investment Adviser. AEPTS is
authorized to transact business in all 50 states and the District of Columbia,
and utilizes AEFA as its primary distribution channel. AEPTS is based in
Minnesota and is regulated and supervised by the OTS, FDIC and SEC.

      AXP Advisors sponsors two wrap programs marketed through financial
advisors, marketing employees and third-party referrals. American Express'r'
Wealth Management Service is a professionally managed discretionary wrap account
based on model portfolios of individual securities. American Express'r'
Strategic Portfolio Service Advantage is a non-discretionary mutual fund and
individual security wrap program built around asset-allocation strategies. At
December 31, 2001, assets in both wrap programs offered by AXP Advisors totaled
$18.7 billion for approximately 217,000 accounts. Late in 2001, AXP Advisors
launched, on a pilot basis, American Express'r' BLUEPRINT'sm', a wrap program
that combines the major features of American Express'r' Wealth Management
Service and American Express'r' Strategic Portfolio Services Advantage.

      AEFA sells real estate investment trusts sponsored by other companies. In
2001, AEFA ceased selling managed futures limited partnerships in which an AEFC
subsidiary is a co-general partner but will continue servicing such limited
partnerships, which subjects AEFA and its affiliated co-general partner to
regulation by the CFTC.

      AEFA and American Express Bank Ltd. operate a jointly owned subsidiary,
American Express International Deposit Company ("AEIDC"), in the Cayman Islands
to accept deposits from foreign clients of American Express Bank Ltd. AEIDC is
not regulated as a bank in the Cayman Islands but its activities are subject to
the review and supervision by the global consolidated supervisor of American
Express Bank Ltd., the New York State Banking Department.

      In an effort to gain a larger proportion of affluent consumers as clients,
in 2001 AEFA developed American Express Platinum Financial Services'sm'. Through
this program, clients receive a variety of premier services, including a
fee-waived Platinum Card'r' with concierge services, financial planning and
advice, banking, insurance products and trust and estate planning services --
with one of AEFA's advisors acting as an overall relationship manager. AEFA will
begin a national rollout of this program in 2002.

      During 2002, AEFA expects to introduce an integrated relationship account
that includes cash products such as FDIC-insured cash accounts, competitive
payment capabilities, consolidated account opening and reporting, enhanced
servicing capabilities and an American Express Card with no annual fee. This new
product is designed to enable AEFA to gather a larger share of its clients'
assets, particularly short-term or cash-equivalent investments.

      AEFA continues to develop new products and modify existing products for
distribution through various distribution channels.

                              AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK

      The Company's American Express Bank business unit ("AEB") offers products
that meet the financial service needs of three primary client groups: retail
customers, wealthy individuals and financial institutions. AEB's operations are
conducted principally through American Express Bank Ltd., a wholly-owned
indirect subsidiary of the Company, and its subsidiaries. AEB does not directly
or indirectly do business in the United States except as an incident to its
activities outside the United States. Accordingly, the following discussion
relating to AEB generally does not distinguish between United States and
non-United States based activities.

      AEB's three primary business lines are Personal Financial Services, The
Private Bank and the Financial Institutions Group. Personal Financial Services
("PFS") provides consumer products in direct response to specific financial
needs of retail customers and includes interest-bearing deposits, unsecured
lines of credit, installment loans, money market funds, mortgage loans, auto
loans and mutual funds. The Private Bank focuses on wealthy individuals by
providing such customers with investment management, trust and estate planning
and banking services, including secured lending. The Financial Institutions
Group provides financial institution clients with a wide range of correspondent
banking products including international payments processing (wire transfers and
checks), trade-related payments and financing, cash management, credit, treasury
and investment products, including third-party distribution of AEB offshore
mutual funds. AEB also provides treasury and capital market products and
services to its customers, including foreign exchange, foreign exchange options,
derivatives and trading, with a focus on emerging markets. Corporate banking is
provided to corporations principally in emerging markets and includes trade
finance and working capital loans.

                                                                              26


      In 2001, AEB continued to shift its business focus from corporate clients
to individuals and financial institutions. This change aligns AEB's businesses
more closely with the rest of the Company and positions it to play a more
important role in the delivery of financial services on a global basis. During
2001, The Private Bank client holdings rose 19 percent to a total of over $12.4
billion and client volumes in PFS increased 9 percent. Due in part to this
change in emphasis, AEB reduced its corporate banking loans by $900 million in
2001 and increased its consumer loans by $1.0 billion ($800 million excluding
the effect of asset sales and securitizations in the consumer loan portfolio).
In addition, financial institution loans fell by $100 million. Loans outstanding
worldwide were approximately $5.3 billion at both December 31, 2001 and 2000.

      During the year, AEB offered a number of new offshore mutual fund and
hedge fund products. AEB's fund products are sold by The Private Bank and PFS
business lines to individual customers and by the Financial Institutions Group
through distributors in several foreign markets. AEB is expanding its reach by
partnering with an increasing number of third-party distributors. During 2001,
AEB signed more than 50 distribution agreements in Europe for the sale of its
own proprietary products, as well as AEFA fund products, and entered into its
first partnership of this kind in Hong Kong. AEB's assets under management in
its fund products totaled approximately $3.0 billion at year-end.

      AEB also continued to work closely with other parts of the Company to
cross-sell products and build deeper relationships with customers. Fifty-six
percent of PFS customers in established PFS markets are also American Express
Cardmembers. AEB also markets its Private Bank services to a highly targeted
group of Cardmembers outside the United States. AEB offers credit products such
as installment loans and revolving lines of credit to both Cardmembers and
non-cardmembers in Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Singapore, Taiwan and the
United Kingdom. AEB also markets a wide range of investment and savings products
to TRS Cardmembers and select non-cardmembers in Germany, Greece, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Singapore and Taiwan. In addition, AXP Advisors has contracted with
AEB to manage most of AEB's American Express Funds and the American Express
Offshore Alternative Investment Fund. As stated earlier, AEB has contracted with
AECC to market AECC's investment certificates, and operates a joint venture
(AEIDC) with AEFC in the Cayman Islands to accept deposits.

      AEB has a global network with offices in 42 countries. Its worldwide
headquarters is located in New York City. It maintains an international banking
agency in New York City and facility offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles,
California. Its wholly-owned Edge Act subsidiary, American Express Bank
International ("AEBI"), is headquartered in Miami, Florida and has branches in
New York City and Miami.

      AEB's business does not, as a whole, experience significant seasonal
fluctuations.

                  SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION REGARDING AEB

      Subject to certain requirements related to transactions with affiliates,
AEB provides banking services to the Company and its subsidiaries. AEB is only
one of many international and local banks used by the Company and its other
subsidiaries, which constitute only a few of AEB's many customers.

      AEB's total assets were $11.9 billion at December 31, 2001 and $11.4
billion at December 31, 2000. Liquid assets, consisting of cash and deposits
with banks, trading account assets and investments, were $5.3 billion at
December 31, 2001 and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2000.

      The following tables present information about AEB's impaired loans. AEB
defines an impaired loan as any loan (other than certain smaller-balance
consumer loans) on which the accrual of interest is discontinued because the
contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or if,
in management's opinion, the borrower is unlikely to meet its contractual
obligations (i.e., non-performing loans). For smaller-balance consumer loans,
management establishes reserves it believes to be adequate to absorb credit
losses inherent in the portfolio. Generally, these loans are written off in full
when an impairment is determined.

(a)   These loans do not require a reserve for credit losses since the values of
      the impaired loans equal or exceed the recorded investments in the loans.

      In addition to the above, AEB had other non-performing assets totaling $22
million, $24 million, and $37 million at December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively. The 2001, 2000 and 1999 balances primarily consist of
contingencies, and matured foreign exchange and derivative contracts.

(a)   The increase in 1998 was mainly due to first quarter credit loss provision
      related to business in the Asia/Pacific region, particularly Indonesia.
(b)   The increases in both 2001 and 1998 were primarily due to write-offs in
      the Asia/Pacific region, primarily Indonesia.
(c)   The increase in 1998 was due to write-offs of Indonesian foreign exchange
      and derivative contracts.
(d)   The increase in 1997 was mainly due to a loan recovery from Peru.

      Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. Loans other than
certain consumer loans are placed on non-performing status when payments of
principal or interest are 90 days past due or if, in management's opinion, the
borrower is unlikely to meet its contractual obligations. When loans are placed
on non-performing status, all previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed
against current interest income. Cash receipts of interest on non-performing
loans are recognized either as interest income or as a reduction of principal,
based upon management's judgment as to the ultimate collectability of principal.
Generally, a non-performing loan may be returned to performing status when all
contractual amounts due are reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable
period and the borrower shows sustained repayment performance, in accordance
with the contractual terms of the loan or when the loan has become well secured
and is in the process of collection.

      Credit card receivables, interest-earning advances under lines of credit
and other similar consumer loans are written off against the reserve for credit
losses upon reaching specified contractual delinquency stages, or earlier in the
event of the borrower's personal bankruptcy or if the loan is otherwise deemed
uncollectible. Interest income on these loans generally accrues until the loan
is written off.

      AEB separately maintains and provides for reserves relating to credit
losses for loans, derivatives and other credit-related commitments. The reserve
is established by charging a provision for credit losses against income. The
amount charged to income is based upon several factors, including historical
credit loss experience in relation to outstanding credits, a continuous
assessment of the collectibility of each credit, and management evaluation of
exposures in each applicable country as related to current and anticipated
economic and political conditions. Management's assessment of the adequacy of
the reserve is inherently subjective, as significant estimates are required.
Amounts deemed uncollectible are charged against the reserve and subsequent
recoveries, if any, are credited to the reserve.

      The reserve for credit losses related to loans is reported as a reduction
of loans. The reserve related to derivatives is reported as a reduction of
trading assets and the reserve related to other credit-related commitments is
reported in other liabilities.

      RISKS

      The global nature of AEB's business activities is such that concentrations
of credit to particular industries and geographic regions are not unusual. At
December 31, 2001, AEB had significant investments in certain on- and
off-balance sheet financial instruments, which were primarily represented by
deposits with banks, securities, loans, forward contracts, contractual amounts
of letters of credit (standby and commercial) and guarantees. The counterparties
to these financial instruments were primarily unrelated to AEB, and principally
consisted of banks and other financial institutions and various commercial and
industrial enterprises operating geographically within the Asia/Pacific region,
Europe, North America, Latin America and the Indian Subcontinent. AEB
continuously monitors its credit concentrations and actively manages to reduce
the associated risk.

      In December 2001 and January 2002, the Argentine government mandated the
conversion of dollar denominated assets into pesos and simultaneously devalued
the peso. AEB's credit exposures to Argentina at December 31, 2001 were $56
million, which includes loans of $25 million.

      In an ongoing effort to mitigate the effects of AEB's credit risks, as
well as its decision to shift its business focus from corporations to
individuals, AEB continued to reduce its wholesale credit exposure in 2001,
particularly with respect to its Asia/Pacific commercial loan portfolio. AEB
continues to carefully monitor its credit exposures.

                                                                              32


      AEB's earnings are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates, as it is
not always possible to match precisely the maturities of interest-related assets
and liabilities. However, strict earnings at risk limits are established at both
the country and overall bank level to limit AEB's exposure to interest rate
fluctuations. On occasion, AEB may decide to mismatch in anticipation of a
change in future interest rates in accordance with these guidelines. Term loans
extended by AEB include both floating interest rate and fixed interest rate
loans.

      Because AEB conducts significant business in emerging market countries and
in countries that are less politically and economically stable than those in the
United States or Western Europe, its PFS and correspondent banking activities
may be subject to greater credit and compliance risks than are found in more
well-developed jurisdictions. AEB continuously monitors its exposures in such
jurisdictions, and regularly evaluates its client base to identify potential
legal risks as a result of clients' use of AEB's banking services.

      For a discussion relating to AEB's use of derivative financial
instruments, see pages 32 through 35 under the caption "Risk Management," and
Note 10 on pages 62 through 63 of the Company's 2001 Annual Report to
Shareholders, which portions of such report are incorporated herein by
reference.

      COMPETITION

      The banking services of AEB are subject to vigorous competition everywhere
AEB operates. Competitors include local and international banks whose assets
often exceed those of AEB, other financial institutions (including certain other
subsidiaries of the Company) and, in certain cases, governmental agencies. In
some countries, AEB may be one of the more substantial financial institutions
offering banking services; in no country, however, is AEB dominant.

      REGULATION

      American Express Bank Ltd. ("AEBL") is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of
American Express Banking Corp. ("AEBC"). AEBC is a New York investment company
organized under Article XII of the New York Banking Law and is a wholly-owned
direct subsidiary of the Company. AEBC, AEBL and AEBL's global network of
offices and subsidiaries are subject to the consolidated supervision and
examination of the New York State Banking Department ("NYSBD") pursuant to the
New York Banking Law. AEBC does not directly engage in banking activities.

      AEBL's branches, representative offices and subsidiaries are licensed and
regulated in the jurisdictions in which they do business and are subject to the
same local requirements as other competitors. Within the United States, AEBL's
New York agency is supervised and regularly examined by the NYSBD. In addition,
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve
Board") regulates, supervises and examines AEBI and the California Department of
Financial Institutions supervises and examines AEBL's San Francisco and Los
Angeles facility offices. AEB Global Asset Management Inc., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of AEBL that provides investment advisory services to private banking
clients, is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser.

      AEB must also comply with various non-U.S. securities regulations,
including the measures imposed under the UK Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 ("FSMA"). The implementation of FSMA (known as N2), which began in December
2001, constitutes a significant change in the regulation of financial services
in the United Kingdom, including the creation of a unified financial services
regulator (the Financial Services Authority) and of a unified regulatory and
supervisory regime for financial services businesses, including deposit-taking,
investment/securities, custody, insurance,



<Page>

                                                                              33


derivatives and mortgage loans. AEB's activities in the United Kingdom, which
were previously regulated under the Banking Act and the Financial Services Act,
are now all regulated under FSMA. The implementation of FSMA across financial
services businesses in the UK may create a more level playing field and increase
competitiveness, although, in the services that AEB provides, there is already
significant competition, both from banks in the UK and elsewhere. FSMA is not
expected to have a significant impact on AEB and its businesses in the UK.

      Since AEBL does not do business in the United States, except as an
incident to its activities outside the United States, the Company's affiliation
with AEBL neither causes the Company to be subject to the provisions of the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, nor requires it to register as a bank
holding company under the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation Y. AEBL is not a
member of the Federal Reserve System, is not subject to supervision by the FDIC,
and is not subject to any of the restrictions imposed by the Competitive
Equality Banking Act of 1987 other than anti-tie-in rules with respect to
transactions involving products and services of certain of its affiliates. AEBL
is not a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.

      AEBL is required to comply with the Federal Reserve Board's risk-based
capital guidelines and complementary leverage constraint applicable to
state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System. Pursuant
to the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, the Federal Reserve Board, among other
federal banking agencies, adopted regulations defining levels of capital
adequacy. Under these regulations, a bank is deemed to be well capitalized if it
maintains a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0 percent, a total
risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0 percent, and a leverage ratio of at
least 5.0 percent. Based on AEBL's total risk-based capital and leverage ratios,
which are set forth on page 27, AEBL is considered to be well capitalized at
December 31, 2001.

      In recent years U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities, together with
international organizations, have raised increasing concerns over the ability of
criminal organizations and corrupt persons to use global financial
intermediaries to facilitate money laundering. In the U.S., the Secretary of the
Treasury has issued regulations pursuant to the USA PATRIOT Act that
specifically impact certain money laundering prevention activities of entities
involved, as AEB is, in correspondent and private banking activities. AEB has
taken steps as necessary to comply with these regulations, and increased its
compliance efforts to combat money laundering generally. AEB may increase these
efforts further to address additional regulation expected under the Patriot Act
as well as other evolving supervisory standards and requirements in
jurisdictions in which AEB does business.

      In December 2001, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the "Basel
Committee") announced its progress toward the completion of a new Basel Capital
Accord (the "New Accord"). The Basel Committee intends to finalize the New
Accord by the end of 2002, and for implementation of the New Accord to begin in
2005. AEBL continues to monitor developments of the Basel Committee and the New
Accord. AEBL believes the New Accord will not have a material adverse effect on
AEBL's capital adequacy or risk based capital compliance. AEBL expects the New
Accord will, however, substantially change assumptions and disclosures related
to capital adequacy, risk based capital, and other related metrics. AEBL,
through its Asset and Liability Committee ("ALCO"), fully intends to comply with
and implement the New Accord as and when required. AEBL believes implementation
of, and compliance efforts required by, the New Accord could result in
substantial changes to certain of AEBL's information systems, processes, and
employee training.

                               CORPORATE AND OTHER

      The American Express brand and its attributes -- trust, security,
integrity, quality and customer service -- are key assets of the Company. The
Company continues to focus on the brand by educating employees about its
attributes and by further incorporating these attributes into its programs,
products and services.

      During the year, the Company also continued a more aggressive strategy in
seeking patents for its businesses. In 2001, 12 U.S. patents and seven foreign
patents were issued to the Company relating to, among other things,
multi-function smart cards, security enhancements in connection with transaction
authorizations, stored value products for the visually impaired and designs for
use with Blue from American Express'sm'.

      The Company uses information about its customers to develop products and
services and to provide personal service. Regulatory activity in the areas of
privacy and data protection is growing worldwide and is generally being driven
by the growth of technology and concomitant concerns about the potentially rapid
and widespread dissemination and use of information. The financial services
modernization legislation enacted in 1999 (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) provides for
disclosure of a financial institution's privacy policies and practices and
affords customers the right to "opt out" of the institution's disclosure of
their personal information to unaffiliated third parties (with limited
exceptions). Federal regulations implementing this legislation became effective
on July 1, 2001. This legislation does not preempt state laws that afford
greater privacy protections to consumers, and several states have proposed such
legislation. In addition, the European Data Protection Directive became
effective in October 1998 and involves potential sanctions for violations which
include the possible disruption in the flow of personal data from Europe and in
the use of such data. The Company will continue its efforts to vigilantly
safeguard the data entrusted to it in accordance with applicable law and its
internal data protection policies, while seeking to properly collect and use
data to achieve its business objectives.

      In February 2002, the Company announced an agreement to out-task most of
its technology operations work to IBM. The agreement has a seven year term with
options to extend. The partnership is expected to improve both the performance
and the efficiency of the Company's global technology infrastructure as well as
save the Company hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of the
agreement. IBM will take on responsibility for managing most of the Company's
day-to-day technology operations functions, including mainframe, midrange and
desktop systems; web hosting; database administration; help desk services; and
data center operations. The Company's Technologies organization will continue to
retain its core technology competencies, including information technology
strategy, managing strategic relationships with technologies' partners,
developing and maintaining applications and databases, and managing the
technologies' portfolios of its businesses.

         As referenced above under "American Express Bank--Regulation," in the
U.S., the USA PATRIOT Act (the "Patriot Act") was enacted in October 2001 in the
wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks. The Patriot Act contains a wide
variety of provisions aimed at fighting terrorism, including provisions aimed at
attacking terrorists' ability to access and move funds used in support of
terrorist activities. Among other things, the Patriot Act directs federal
regulators, led by the Secretary of the Treasury, to promulgate regulations or
take other steps to require financial institutions to establish anti-money
laundering programs that meet certain standards, including expanded reporting
and enhanced information gathering and record keeping requirements. While the
Company has long maintained money laundering prevention programs in its
businesses, the Secretary of the Treasury has issued regulations under the
Patriot Act applicable to AEB prescribing minimum standards for such anti-money
laundering programs, and it is anticipated that further regulations applicable
to certain of the Company's other businesses will be issued in the future. The
Company intends to take steps to comply with any regulations that are ultimately
promulgated. In addition, the Company will take steps to comply with anti-money
laundering initiatives adopted in the other jurisdictions in which it conducts
business.

      Recently, numerous legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to
address issues that were raised in connection with the collapse of Enron. These
proposals relate to areas such as 401(k) and pension plans, auditor independence
and accounting oversight, financial reporting and disclosure (including for
stock options), executive compensation, analyst conflicts of interest, corporate
governance and taxation, among others. Some of these proposals, if adopted,
could have an impact on various aspects of the Company's businesses. For
example, certain proposals regarding 401(k) and pension plans could, if adopted,
affect AEFA's retirement services business and proposals regarding auditor
independence could, if adopted, affect TBS.

      The Balcor Company Holdings, Inc., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company, and its subsidiaries, formerly operated as a diversified real
estate investment and management company, discontinued new commercial real
estate activities in 1990 and began to liquidate its portfolio of real



<Page>

                                                                              35


estate loans and properties. The liquidation was completed in 1998. Balcor and
its subsidiaries also served as general partners in numerous public limited
partnerships, the last of which were dissolved in December 2000.

                               FOREIGN OPERATIONS

      The Company derives a significant portion of its revenues from the use of
the Card, Travelers Cheques and travel services in countries outside the United
States and continues to broaden the use of these products and services outside
the United States. Political and economic conditions in these countries,
including the availability of foreign exchange for the payment by the local card
issuer of obligations arising out of local Cardmembers' spending outside such
country, for the payment of card bills by Cardmembers who are billed in other
than their local currency and for the remittance of the proceeds of Travelers
Cheque sales, can have an effect on the Company's revenues. Substantial and
sudden devaluation of local Cardmembers' currency can also affect their ability
to make payments to the local issuer of the card on account of spending outside
the local country. The major portion of AEB's banking revenues is from business
conducted in countries outside the United States. Some of the risks attendant to
those operations include currency fluctuations and changes in political,
economic and legal environments in each such country.

      As a result of its foreign operations, the Company is exposed to the
possibility that, because of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, assets and
liabilities denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar may be
realized in amounts greater or lesser than the United States dollar amounts at
which they are currently recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statements. Examples of transactions in which this may occur include the
purchase by Cardmembers of goods and services in a currency other than the
currency in which they are billed; the sale in one currency of a Travelers
Cheque denominated in a second currency; foreign exchange positions held by AEB
as a consequence of its client-related foreign exchange trading operations; and,
in most instances, investments in foreign operations. These risks, unless
properly monitored and managed, could have an adverse effect on the Company's
operations.

      The Company's policy in this area is generally to monitor closely all
foreign exchange positions and to minimize foreign exchange gains and losses,
for example, by offsetting foreign currency assets with foreign currency
liabilities, as in the case of foreign currency loans and receivables, which are
financed in the same currency. An additional technique used to manage exposures
is the spot and forward purchase or sale of foreign currencies as a hedge of net
exposures in those currencies as, for example, in the case of the Cardmember and
Travelers Cheque transactions described above. Additionally, Cardmembers may be
charged in United States dollars for their spending outside their local country.
The Company's investments in foreign operations are hedged by forward exchange
contracts or by identifiable transactions, where appropriate.

             IMPORTANT FACTORS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

      Various forward-looking statements have been made in this Form 10-K Annual
Report. Forward-looking statements may also be made in the Company's other
reports filed with the SEC, in its press releases and in other documents. In
addition, from time to time, the Company through its management may make oral
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and
uncertainties, including those identified below, which could cause actual
results to differ materially from such statements. The words "believe,"
"expect," "anticipate," "optimistic," "intend," "plan," "aim," "will," "should,"
"could" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking
statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are
made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or

                                                                              36


revise any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results
to differ materially from the Company's forward-looking statements include but
are not limited to the following:

      The Company's inability to:

      o     successfully implement a business model that allows for significant
            earnings growth based on revenue growth that is lower than
            historical levels;

      o     extend the value of the American Express brand, which historically
            has been associated with the card and travel businesses (e.g.,
            perception of trust, security and quality service), to a broad range
            of financial products and services in the financial services
            industry;

      o     manage credit risk related to consumer debt, business loans and
            other credit exposures, both in the United States and abroad,
            including unseasoned balances in TRS' lending portfolios;

      o     successfully achieve in a timely manner significant cost savings and
            other benefits from the reengineering efforts being implemented or
            considered by the Company, including cost management, structural and
            strategic measures such as vendor, process, facilities and
            operations consolidation, outsourcing functions (including, among
            others, technologies operations), relocating certain functions
            to lower cost overseas locations, moving internal and external
            functions to the Internet to save costs, the scale-back of corporate
            lending in certain regions, and planned staff reductions relating to
            certain of such reengineering actions;

      o     successfully expand its on-line and off-line distribution channels
            and cross-selling for, financial, travel, card and other products
            and services to its customer base, both in the U.S. and
            internationally;

      o     participate in payment and other systems material to its businesses
            on a fair and competitive basis;

      o     control and manage operating, infrastructure, advertising and
            promotion and other expenses as business expands or changes,
            including balancing the need for longer term investment spending;

      o     invest successfully in, and compete at the leading edge of,
            technology developments across all businesses, e.g., transaction
            processing, data management, customer interactions and
            communications, travel reservations systems, stored value products,
            multi-application smart cards and risk management systems;

      o     to recover under its insurance policies for losses resulting from
            the September 11th terrorist attacks;

      o     recognize evolutionary technology developments by competitors or
            others which could hasten business model obsolescence or, because of
            patent rights held by such competitors or others, limit or restrict
            the Company's use of desired business technology or processes;

      o     develop and implement successfully enterprise-wide interactive
            strategies;

      o     improve online customer satisfaction, website performance and
            availability for its customers and clients;



<Page>

                                                                              37


      o     effectively leverage its assets, such as its brand, customers and
            international presence in the Internet environment; and

      o     attract and retain qualified employees in all its businesses.

      TRS' inability to:

      o     increase consumer and business spending and borrowing on its credit
            and charge Cards and travel related services products, gain market
            share and develop new or enhanced products that capture greater
            share of customers' total spending on Cards issued on its network
            both in the United States and in its international operations;

      o     execute the Company's global corporate services strategy including
            greater penetration of middle market companies, increasing capture
            on non-T&E spending through greater use of the Company's purchase
            card and other means, and further globalizing business capabilities;

      o     manage credit risk and exposure in a challenging economic
            environment;

      o     cost effectively manage and expand Cardmember benefits, including
            MEMBERSHIP REWARDS;

      o     expand the global network services business;

      o     successfully acquire and convert credit card portfolios from other
            card issuers;

      o     enhance significantly its international operations, which will
            depend in part on its ability to reduce expenses for reinvestment in
            the international business and expand the proprietary and third
            party-issued Card businesses;

      o     retain Cardmembers in consumer lending products after low
            introductory rate periods have expired; and

      o     sustain premium discount rates, increase merchant coverage and
            reduce suppression, all of which will depend in part on its ability
            to maintain a customer base that appeals to merchants and to develop
            deeper merchant relationships through creation of new products and
            services.

      AEFA's inability to:

      o     sell certain high-yield investments at expected values and within
            anticipated timeframes and to maintain its high-yield portfolio at
            certain levels in the future;

      o     manage investment performance in AEFA's businesses, including
            attracting and retaining high-quality personnel;

      o     develop and roll out new and attractive products to clients in a
            timely manner and effectively manage the economics in selling a
            growing volume of non-proprietary products to clients;

      o     manage developments relating to AEFA's platform structure for
            financial advisors, including the ability to increase advisor
            productivity, increase the growth of productive new advisors and
            create efficiencies in the infrastructure;

      o     resolve the potential conflicts inherent in its growing

            result in contingent payments under contracts, decreased liquidity
            and higher borrowing costs;

      o     the effect of fluctuating interest rates, which could affect AEFA's
            spreads in the investment and insurance businesses and benefits

            AEB's return on lending products;

                                                                              41


ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

      The Company's headquarters is in a 51-story, 2.2 million square foot
building located in lower Manhattan, which also serves as the headquarters for
TRS and AEB. This building, which is on land leased from the Battery Park City
Authority for a term expiring in 2069, is one of four office buildings in a
complex known as the World Financial Center. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. also
owns 52 percent of the building.

      Due to its proximity to the World Trade Center, the Company's headquarters
was damaged as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Repairs
to the headquarters building have been slowed due to the continuation of work to
clear debris at the World Trade Center site. The repair work to the Company's
headquarters is expected to be completed in stages during 2002. Additionally,
the Company leased approximately 93,700 square feet of space in the 7 World
Trade Center building, which was destroyed on September 11. As a result of these
events, the Company has had to temporarily relocate its headquarters. Certain of
its employees were relocated to two properties leased by the Company in New York
City and in Jersey City, New Jersey. Additionally, the Company entered into five
new leases for approximately 750,000 square feet of space in the New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut area. The Company expects to sublease portions of its
space in the tri-state area upon the completion of the work to the World
Financial Center and the return of employees to the corporate headquarters,
which is expected to begin in Spring 2002. In March 2002, the Company further
announced that it intends to relocate back to the World Financial Center
employees at its Jersey City facility who had been permanently based at such
location prior to September 11. The Company intends to sublease most, if not
all, of this space.

      Other principal locations of TRS include: the American Express Service
Centers in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; Greensboro, North
Carolina; Salt Lake City, Utah; and the Amex Canada Inc. headquarters in
Markham, Ontario, Canada, all of which are owned by the Company or its
subsidiaries. In November, 2000, a 99-year lease was entered into with the State
of Arizona for land in Phoenix on which the Company is currently building two
office buildings with a total of 371,000 square feet. Construction on this new
project commenced in 2001 with construction expected to be completed in late
2002.

      AEFA's principal locations are its headquarters, the American Express
Financial Center, which the company leases, and its Operations Center, which the
company owns; both are in Minneapolis, Minnesota. AEFA's lease term for the
American Express Financial Center, which began in November 2000, is for 20 years
with several options to extend the term. AEFA also owns Oak Ridge Conference
Center, a training facility and conference center in Chaska, Minnesota.

      In February 2002, AEFA began to occupy a new Client Service Center in
downtown Minneapolis, which AEFC owns.

      IDS Property Casualty, a subsidiary of AEFA, owns its corporate
headquarters in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

      Generally, the Company and its subsidiaries lease the premises they occupy
in other locations. Facilities owned or occupied by the Company and its
subsidiaries are believed to be adequate for the purposes for which they are
used and are well maintained.

      In February 2000, the Company entered into a 10-year agreement with
Trammell Crow Corporate Services, Inc. for facilities, project and transaction
management and other related services. The agreement covers North and South
America and parts of Europe.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

      The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of legal and
arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the
conduct of their respective business activities. The Company believes it has
meritorious defenses to each of these actions and intends to defend them
vigorously. The Company believes that it is not a party to, nor are any of its
properties the subject of, any pending legal or arbitration proceedings which
would have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial
condition, although it is possible that the outcome of any such proceedings
could have a material impact on the Company's net income in any particular
period. Certain legal proceedings involving the Company are set forth below.

      A number of lawsuits involving insurance sales practices, alleged agent
misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents and other matters relating to
life insurance policies and annuity contracts have been filed against life and
health insurers in jurisdictions in which IDS Life Insurance Company and its
affiliates do business. IDS Life and its affiliates, like other life and health
insurers, are involved in such litigation. IDS Life was a named defendant in
three class action lawsuits of this nature. On December 13, 1996, an action
entitled LESA BENAQUISTO V. IDS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY AND AMERICAN EXPRESS
FINANCIAL CORPORATION was commenced in Minnesota state court. A second action,
entitled ARNOLD MORK, ISABELLA MORK, RONALD MELCHERT AND SUSAN MELCHERT V. IDS
LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY AND AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL CORPORATION was commenced
in the same court on March 21, 1997. On October 13, 1998, an action entitled
RICHARD W. AND ELIZABETH J. THORESEN V. AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL CORPORATION,
AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE INSURANCE
COMPANY, AMERICAN PARTNERS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, IDS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY
AND IDS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK was also commenced in Minnesota state
court. These three class action lawsuits included allegations of improper
insurance and annuity sales practices including improper replacement of existing
annuity contracts and insurance policies, improper use of annuities to fund tax
deferred contributory retirement plans, alleged agent misconduct, failure to
properly supervise agents and other matters relating to life insurance policies
and annuity contracts.

      In January 2000, American Express Financial Corporation and its
subsidiaries ("AEFC") reached an agreement in principle to settle the three
class-action lawsuits described above. It is expected the settlement will
provide $215 million of benefits to more than two million participants in
exchange for a release by class members of all insurance and annuity market
conduct claims dating back to 1985.

      In August 2000, an action entitled LESA BENAQUISTO, DANIEL BENAQUISTO,
RICHARD THORESEN, ELIZABETH THORESEN, ARNOLD MORK, ISABELLA MORK, RONALD
MELCHERT AND SUSAN MELCHERT V. AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL CORPORATION, AMERICAN
EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS, AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY, AMERICAN
ENTERPRISE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, AMERICAN PARTNERS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, IDS
LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY AND IDS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK was commenced
in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The complaint
put at issue various alleged sales practices and misrepresentations and
allegations of violations of federal laws.

      In May 2001, the United States District Court for the District of
Minnesota and the District Court, Fourth Judicial District for the State of
Minnesota, Hennepin County entered orders approving the settlement as
tentatively reached in January, 2000. Appeals were filed in both federal and
state court but subsequently dismissed by the parties filing the appeals. The
orders approving the settlement were final as of September 24, 2001.
Implementation of the settlement commenced October 15, 2001.

      Numerous individuals opted out of the settlement described above and
therefore did not release their claims against AEFC. Some of these class members
who opted out were represented by counsel and

                                                                              43


presented separate claims to AEFC. Most of their claims have been settled. The
outcome of any litigation or threatened litigation cannot be predicted with any
certainty; however, in the aggregate, the Company does not consider these
lawsuits or threatened lawsuits to be material.

      On March 29, 1999 an action entitled LAMBERT V. AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL
CORPORATION, AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS INC., IDS LIFE INSURANCE
AGENCIES, INC., IDS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, AMERICAN EXPRESS BENEFIT PLAN
COMMITTEE, CAREER DISTRIBUTORS PLAN COMMITTEE AND JOHN/JANE DOES 1-20 was
commenced in U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota, Fourth Division. The
original named plaintiff purports to represent a class consisting of financial
advisors who were independent contractors from January 1, 1993 through March 22,
2000. The Complaint alleges class members were misclassified as independent
contractors and seeks retroactive coverage in all employee health, welfare,
retirement and compensation plans, and payment of FICA and FUTA taxes. The
Complaint also alleges violation of ERISA, breach of contract, breach of duty of
good faith and fair dealing and unjust enrichment. The Complaint was amended on
July 26, 1999, adding three plaintiffs, adding new claims for conversion,
rescission of the financial advisors agreement and declaratory judgment and
adding AEFC's Employee Benefits Administration Committee as a defendant.

      In August, 2001, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, pursuant
to which AEFC agreed to pay $15,000,000 into a settlement fund for full
resolution of the case. On December 7, 2001, the Court issued its final approval
and the matter has been concluded.

      Beginning in October 1999, sixteen former and current female financial
advisors at American Express Financial Advisors ("AEFA") filed charges with the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), including class claims on
behalf of all women advisors at AEFA, alleging that they and other women were
discriminated against in hiring, assignment of work, distribution of leads,
training and promotions. All of the charges were consolidated with the EEOC in
Minnesota. Although AEFA felt it had meritorious defenses to all the claims, the
prospect of a long and protracted litigation and the attendant publicity led it
to conclude that settlement was a more prudent course of action. After two years
of negotiation, AEFA entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs'
counsel to settle all the claims. Under the proposed settlement, AEFA will pay
$31,000,000 into a fund for distribution to a potential class consisting of
approximately 4,000 current and former advisors. AEFA has also agreed to certain
affirmative relief such as appointing an internal diversity officer, changing
its process for assigning client accounts and leads, and diversity training.

      In order to have a binding settlement on all potential class members,
plaintiffs' counsel filed a Class Action Complaint in Federal Court in
Washington D.C., in January 2002. The proposed settlement agreement was filed
with the court shortly thereafter. A lengthy approval process needs to take
place before the settlement will be final, including written notice to all
class members and review by the judge assigned to the case. This process is
expected to take several months.

      On August 15, 2000, Roger M. Lindmark ("Lindmark") filed a putative class
action lawsuit against American Express Company, American Express Travel Related
Services Company, Inc. and American Express Centurion Bank ("AECB") in the
United States District Court for the Central District of California. The
complaint principally alleges that class members improperly were charged daily
compounded interest on the Optima line of credit cards and that AECB improperly
applied credits for returned merchandise against Optima balance transfer
balances. Lindmark asserts various claims including violation of the federal
Truth In Lending Act, breach of contract, fraud and unfair and deceptive
practices and violations of the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act. The
action seeks statutory and actual damages, restitution and injunctive relief.

                                 AMENDMENTS TO
               AMERICAN EXPRESS SENIOR EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN
                           EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 1994

                (Amendments Effective as of November 26, 2001)


1.      Section 2.2 of the American Express Senior Executive Severance Plan,
        effective January 1, 1994, as amended (the "Plan"), is hereby deleted in
        its entirety and replaced with a new Section 2.2 to read as follows:

        2.2      LIMITATION ON ELIGIBILITY. In the event an Employee who is
                 otherwise eligible for participation in the Plan is offered a
                 Comparable Position (whether the position is accepted or
                 rejected by the Employee), the Employee will not be eligible to
                 participate in the Plan. In addition, an Employee is not
                 eligible to participate in the Plan if the Employee accepts any
                 position in the Employing Company, an Affiliated Company or
                 successor company (regardless of whether it is a Comparable
                 Position). An Employee who is a member of the Company's
                 Planning and Policy Committee and who otherwise meets the
                 eligibility criteria may only participate in the Plan if
                 approved by the CBC in advance. An Employee who is offered or
                 placed on a temporary layoff status (often referred to as a
                 furlough) with reduced or no pay for a period of less than six
                 months during which time the Employee continues to participate
                 in certain benefit plans as determined by the Company is not
                 eligible to participate in the Plan.

2.      Section 3.2 of the Plan is hereby deleted in its entirety and
        replaced with a new Section 3.2 to read as follows:

        3.2      LIMITATIONS ON AMOUNT OF SEVERANCE BENEFITS. The number of
                 weeks of severance benefits payable to any eligible Employee
                 under the Plan shall not exceed 104 weeks. Such benefits
                 payable under the Plan shall be inclusive of and offset by any
                 other severance, redundancy or termination payment made by an
                 Employing Company, including but not limited to, any amounts
                 paid pursuant to federal, state, local or foreign government
                 worker notification (e.g., Worker Adjustment and Retraining
                 Notification Act) or office closing requirements, any amounts
                 owed the Employee pursuant to a contract with the Employing
                 Company (unless the contract specifically provides otherwise)
                 and amounts paid to an Employee placed in a temporary layoff
                 status (often referred to as a furlough) which immediately
                 precedes the commencement of severance payments.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

During 2001, American Express Company's (the company) financial results
reflected generally worsening economic conditions throughout the year, including
weakness in billings and investment activity, as well as significantly lower
travel and entertainment related spending after the terrorist attacks of
September 11th.

The company reported 2001 net income of $1.31 billion, 53 percent lower than the
$2.81 billion in 2000, which represented 14 percent growth from 1999. The 2001
results included restructuring charges of $411 million (after-tax) and $65
million (after-tax) of one-time costs and business interruption losses related
to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. These costs are discussed in greater
detail below. Excluding these items, 2001 net income fell 36 percent to $1.79
billion.

Diluted earnings per share were $0.98, $2.07 and $1.81 in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. After adjusting 2001 for the above-mentioned restructuring and
September 11th related items, diluted earnings per share were $1.34. On this
basis, 2001 earnings per share declined 35 percent.

2001 results also included losses of $1.01 billion ($669 million after-tax)
recorded in the first half of the year related to the write down and sale of
some high-yield securities and the reduction of risk within American Express
Financial Advisors' (AEFA) investment portfolio. 2000 results reflect
approximately $123 million ($88 million after-tax) of such losses.

Consolidated net revenues on a managed basis declined 3 percent in 2001 to $21.4
billion, compared with $22.1 billion in 2000, which represented 13 percent
growth from 1999. 2001 net revenues declined due to lower spreads on AEFA's
investment portfolio, which reflect the investment losses and portfolio
repositioning mentioned above, weaker travel revenues, as well as lower
management and distribution fees. These items were partially offset by an
increase in cards-in-force, larger loan balances and greater insurance revenues.
Consolidated expenses on a managed basis rose 8 percent in 2001 due to the
previously mentioned charges, larger provisions for losses and higher operating
expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower marketing costs, a
decline in human resource expenses, reengineering activities and other expense
control initiatives.

In the third and fourth quarters of 2001, the company incurred restructuring
charges of $352 million ($232 million after-tax) and $279 million ($179 million
after-tax), respectively, resulting in total charges of $631 million ($411
million after-tax) for the full year. The pretax charges include $369 million
for severance and $262 million of other charges, including facility
consolidations and exit costs. The savings for 2002 resulting from these
initiatives is expected to be approximately $605 million, a portion of which
will flow through to earnings in the form of improved operating expense margins.
The rest is expected to be reinvested back into business areas with high-growth
potential. The combined charges, planned employee reductions and estimated cost
savings by segment are as follows. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information.

* THE MAJORITY OF EMPLOYEE REDUCTIONS WILL OCCUR IN 2002. THESE ARE IN ADDITION
TO APPROXIMATELY 1,600 REDUCTIONS IDENTIFIED THIS YEAR FROM ONGOING
REENGINEERING ACTIVITIES.

Overall, the full year results reflected strong progress on reengineering
efforts, which, including the effect of the two restructuring charges, resulted
in benefits in excess of $1.0 billion distributed among reduced operating
expenses and provisions, and to a lesser extent, increased revenues. A portion
of these benefits flowed through to results of operations while the rest was
reinvested back into high-growth areas of the business.

                                       1             (2001 Annual Report p. 28)




<Page>

In the third quarter of 2001, the company incurred $98 million ($65 million
after-tax) of one-time costs and business interruption losses related to the
September 11th terrorist attacks. These losses included provisions for credit
exposures to travel industry service establishments and insurance claims, as
well as approximately $8 million of waived finance charges and late fees. The
company also incurred costs of approximately $58 million since September 11th,
which are expected to be covered by insurance and, consequently, did not impact
results. These include the cost of duplicate facilities and equipment associated
with the relocation of the company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain
other business recovery expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the
company's offices, extra operating expenses and business interruption losses are
still being evaluated. As of January 2002, approximately $30 million of such
costs relating to the company's portion of the repair of its headquarters
building have been identified. The company expects that a substantial portion of
these losses will be covered by insurance.

The company expects a weak economy in 2002. As a result, achieving revenue
growth targets will be a challenge as, at a minimum, year-over-year revenue
trends will be under pressure in the first half of 2002 as two key drivers,
Cardmember spending and equity valuations, will face difficult comparisons.
During 2001, the company made some important changes to reduce risk and build a
more flexible cost structure. The benefits expected from the restructuring
charges and ongoing reengineering efforts position the business so earnings
growth and solid returns can be achieved at lower levels of revenue growth.

This financial review is presented on the basis used by management to evaluate
operations. It differs in two respects from the accompanying financial
statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States(GAAP). First, results are presented as
if there had been no asset securitizations at Travel Related Services (TRS).
This format is generally termed on a "managed basis." Second, revenues are shown
net of AEFA's provisions for annuities, insurance and investment certificates
products, which are essentially spread businesses.

CERTAIN CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
In December 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a
financial reporting release, FR-60, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure
About Critical Accounting Policies." In this connection, the following
information has been provided about certain critical accounting policies that
are important to the Consolidated Financial Statements and that entail, to a
significant extent, the use of estimates, assumptions and the application of
management's judgment. These policies relate to reserves for Cardmember credit
losses, MEMBERSHIP REWARDS costs, the recognition of impairment within the
investment portfolio and deferred acquisition costs.

- - Provisions for credit losses related to Cardmember loans and receivables is
  one of the largest operating expenses of the company. Reserves for these
  credit losses are primarily based upon statistically driven models derived
  from historical experience, as well as management judgment as to the economic
  and business environment. In determining the reserves, management evaluates
  both internal credit metrics, such as migration analysis, write-off rates,
  recovery rates and net write-off coverage, as well as external economic data,
  such as unemployment, bankruptcy filings and consumer confidence, among other
  indicators that may impact the portfolios. To the extent historical credit
  experience is not indicative of future performance or other assumptions used
  by management do not prevail, loss experience could differ significantly,
  resulting in either higher or lower future provision for losses, as
  applicable.

- - The company's MEMBERSHIP REWARDS Loyalty Program allows Cardmembers to earn
  points that can be redeemed for a broad range of travel rewards, retail
  merchandise and gourmet gifts. The company makes payments to merchants when
  Cardmembers redeem their points and establishes reserves in connection with
  such redemptions. The provision for the cost of MEMBERSHIP REWARDS is based
  upon points awarded in the current year which are ultimately expected to be
  redeemed by program members and the current average cost per point of
  redemption. The cumulative liability for unredeemed points is adjusted over
  time based on actual experience and current trends with respect to
  redemptions. To the extent that the assumptions differ from actual
  redemptions, the company's future MEMBERSHIP REWARD program cost could be
  higher or lower, as applicable.

- - Generally, investment securities are carried at fair value on the balance
  sheet. Gains and losses are recognized in the results of operations upon
  disposition of the securities. In addition, losses are also recognized when
  management determines that a decline in value is not temporary, which requires
  judgment regarding the amount and timing of recovery. Typically, the company

                                       2             (2001 Annual Report p. 29)




<Page>

  defines an event of impairment for debt securities as issuer default or
  bankruptcy. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices. However,
  the company's investment portfolio also contains structured investments of
  various asset quality, including Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) and
  Structured Loan Trusts (backed by high-yield bonds and bank loans,
  respectively), which are not readily marketable. As a result, the carrying
  values of these structured investments are based on cash flow projections
  which require a significant degree of judgment and as such are subject to
  change. If actual future cash flows are less than projected, additional losses
  would be realized.

- - AEFA's deferred acquisition costs (DAC) represent costs of acquiring new
  business, principally sales and other distribution and underwriting costs,
  that have been deferred on the sale of annuity, insurance, and certain mutual
  fund and other long-term products. DACs are amortized over the lives of the
  products, either as a constant percentage of projected earnings or as a
  constant percentage of the projected liabilities associated with such
  products. Such projections require the use of certain assumptions, including
  interest margins, mortality rates, persistency rates, maintenance expense
  levels and, for variable products, separate account performance. As actual
  experience differs from the current assumptions, management considers on a
  quarterly basis the need to change key assumptions underlying the amortization
  models prospectively. For example, if the stock market trend rose or declined
  appreciably, it could impact assumptions made about separate account
  performance and result in an adjustment to income, either positively or
  negatively. The impact on results of operations of changing prospective
  assumptions with respect to the amortization of DACs is reflected in the
  period in which such changes are made.

CONSOLIDATED LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The company believes allocating capital to its growing businesses with a return
on risk-adjusted equity in excess of their cost of capital will continue to
build shareholder value.

The company's philosophy is to retain enough earnings to provide capital such
that the company can meet its growth objectives. To the extent capital available
has exceeded investment opportunities, the company has returned excess capital
to shareholders. The company has in place share repurchase programs to both
offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans and
reduce shares outstanding. Due to the negative impact of the 2001 restructuring
and disaster recovery charges and high-yield losses discussed in the
Consolidated Results of Operations, no share repurchases occurred during the
second half of 2001 and none are anticipated for approximately the first half of
2002.

In 1999 and 2000, the company entered into agreements under which a third party
purchased 29 million company common shares at an average purchase price of
$50.41 per share. These agreements, which partially offset the company's
exposure from its stock option program, are separate from the company's
previously authorized share repurchase program. During the term of these
agreements, the company will periodically issue shares to or receive shares from
the third party so that the value of the shares held by the third party equals
the original purchase price for the shares. At maturity in five years, the
company is required to deliver to the third party an amount equal to such
original purchase price. The company may elect to settle this amount (i)
physically, by paying cash against delivery of the shares held by the third
party or (ii) on a net cash or net share basis. The company may also prepay
outstanding amounts at any time prior to the end of the five-year term. In 2001,
the company elected to prepay $350 million of the aggregate outstanding amount,
which resulted in 8 million shares being delivered to the company. Net
settlements under these agreements resulted in the company issuing 12 million
shares in 2001 and receiving 2 million shares in 2000.

In January 2002, the SEC issued a financial reporting release, FR-61,
"Commission Statement about Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations." In this release, the SEC recommended that
registrants enhance their disclosure of matters concerning liquidity and capital
resources, including off-balance sheet arrangements, certain trading activities
involving non-exchange traded contracts, and transactions with related and
certain other parties. The specific matters significant to the company include
on-balance sheet funding, off-balance sheet asset securitizations and contingent
obligations, such as Cardmember credit lines, letters of credit and guarantees.
These areas are discussed either in this section of the financial review or in
each operating segment's financial review. The company does not believe it has
any significant transactions with related parties.

Further, the company's transactions with its executive officers, such as use of
American Express Cards and AEFA financial services, are on terms and conditions
available to its employees generally.

The following table presents certain contingencies and commitments of the
company relating to long-term debt and off-balance sheet financial instruments.

NOTE: YEARS REFLECT MATURITIES OF DEBT AND LEASE OPERATING EXPENSES AND PERIODS
OTHER OBLIGATIONS ARE OUTSTANDING.

The company is committed to extend credit to certain Cardmembers as part of
established lending product agreements. Many of these are not expected to be
drawn; therefore, total unused credit available to Cardmembers does not
represent future cash requirements. The company's Charge Card products have no
preset spending limit and are not reflected in unused credit available to
Cardmembers.

The company issues commercial and other letters of credit to facilitate the
short-term trade-related needs of its banking clients, which typically mature
within six months. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the company held $583 million
and $687 million, respectively, of collateral supporting standby letters of
credit and guarantees and $159 million and $242 million, respectively, of
collateral supporting commercial and other letters of credit.

In addition to the contingencies and commitments listed above, the company has
entered into many other contracts in the normal course of business that involve
future cash payments, which are either required or contingent upon the
occurrence of certain events. Management believes payments under these contracts
will not have a material adverse impact on liquidity.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES
The company's most significant borrowing and liquidity needs are associated with
TRS' card businesses. TRS pays merchants for point of sale card transactions and
bills Cardmembers accordingly. TRS must fund merchant payments during the period
Cardmember loans and receivables are outstanding. As of December 31, 2001,
Cardmember loans and receivables managed were approximately $62 billion.

AEFA's borrowing needs are less significant as its funds are generated through
operations, primarily by the sale of insurance or certificate products. American
Express Bank's (AEB) principal funding source is customer deposits. It could
experience a tightening of liquidity if customer deposits were withdrawn to the
extent that loans, which are generally not readily marketable, would have to be
liquidated. Such a tightening, which is not expected to occur, could be funded,
among other means, by the sale of investment securities.

The company has procedures to immediately transfer short-term funds within the
company to meet liquidity needs. These procedures include Parent Company support
of its subsidiaries' funding. Internal transfer mechanisms are subject to and
comply with various contractual and regulatory constraints.

The company's major borrowing sources (and amounts outstanding at December 31,
2001) include commercial paper issued by American Express Credit Corporation
(Credco), a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRS ($18 billion), bank notes issued and
Fed Funds purchased by American Express Centurion Bank (Centurion Bank), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of TRS ($10 billion), Cardmember lending securitizations
($13 billion off-balance sheet), and Charge Card receivable securitizations ($3
billion on-balance sheet). In

                                       4             (2001 Annual Report p. 31)




<Page>

addition, the company maintains committed back-up lines of credit ($10 billion
to support Credco commercial paper and $3 billion for other purposes). See each
segment's Liquidity and Capital Resources section for discussion of specific
activities.

The availability of the credit lines is subject to the company's compliance with
certain financial covenants, including the maintenance by the company of
consolidated tangible net worth of at least $6.5 billion, the maintenance by
Credco of a 1.25 ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges
and the compliance by Centurion Bank with applicable regulatory capital adequacy
guidelines. At December 31, 2001, consolidated tangible net worth was
approximately $11.1 billion, Credco's ratio of combined earnings and fixed
charges to fixed charges was 1.29 and Centurion Bank exceeded the FDIC's "well
capitalized" regulatory capital adequacy guidelines.

The company's credit ratings are critical to maintaining short-term funding
sources and determining related interest costs. Rating agencies review factors
such as capital adequacy with a view towards maintaining certain levels of
capital, liquidity, business volumes, asset quality and economic market trends,
among others, in assessing the company's appropriate ratings. Subsequent to the
terrorist attacks of September 11th, the company's A+ and its subsidiaries'
credit ratings were affirmed by Standard & Poor's and Fitch, two credit rating
agencies. At the same time, however, each agency revised its respective rating
outlook on the company and its subsidiaries from stable to negative in light of
the ensuing weak climate for business and consumer travel and spending and
weaker capital markets. In their statements, the rating agencies indicated that
while the company has significant financial resources to address short-term
business volume disruptions, if business volumes remained depressed for an
extended period, its credit ratings would be under pressure. See Risk Management
section below for a discussion of the effect of a two level downgrade.

The Parent Company has short-term funding needs relating to shareholder
dividends and other general corporate purposes. These are generally met through
an intercompany dividend policy. The Board of Directors has authorized a Parent
Company commercial paper program that is supported by a $1.9 billion
multi-purpose credit facility that expires in increments through 2006. No
borrowings have been made under this credit facility, and there was no Parent
Company commercial paper outstanding during 2001 or 2000.

Total Parent Company long-term debt outstanding was $2.1 billion and $1.4
billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. During 2001, the Parent
Company issued in two traunches an aggregate of $1 billion of 5.5 percent notes
due 2006, using the proceeds for general corporate purposes. At December 31,
2001 and 2000, the Parent Company had $3.6 billion and $4.6 billion,
respectively, of debt or equity securities available for issuance under shelf
registrations filed with the SEC. In addition, TRS, Centurion Bank, Credco,
American Express Overseas Credit Corporation Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Credco, and AEB have established programs for the issuance, outside the
United States, of debt instruments to be listed on the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange. The maximum aggregate principal amount of debt instruments outstanding
at any one time under the program will not exceed $6.0 billion. At December 31,
2001 and 2000, $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion of debt, respectively, was
outstanding under this program.

RISK MANAGEMENT
The company's objective is to monitor and control risk exposures to earn returns
commensurate with the level of risk assumed.

Management establishes and oversees implementation of Board-approved policies
covering the company's funding, investments and the use of derivative financial
instruments. The company's treasury department, along with various asset and
liability committees in the businesses, is responsible for managing financial
market risk exposures within the context of Board-approved policies. See Note 10
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the company's use
of derivatives.

In the second half of 2001, the company established the Corporate Risk
Management Committee (CRMC) to supplement the risk management capabilities
resident within its business segments by routinely reviewing key market, credit
and other risk concentrations across the company and recommending corrective
action where appropriate. The CRMC promotes a rigorous understanding of risks
across the company and supports senior management in making risk-return
decisions.

Management considers the risk of liquidity and cost of funds from the company's
market related activities. Management believes a decline in the company's
long-term credit rating by two levels could result in the company having to
significantly reduce its commercial paper and other short-term market borrowings
and replace them, in part, by taking down existing credit lines. Remaining

                                       5             (2001 Annual Report p. 32)




<Page>

borrowing requirements would be addressed through other means such as additional
securitizations and sale or repurchase of investment securities. This would
result in higher interest expense on the company's commercial paper and other
debt, as well as higher fees related to unused lines of credit. The company
believes a two level downgrade is unlikely due to its capital position and
growth prospects.

The following sections include sensitivity analyses of three different types of
market risk and estimate the effects of hypothetical sudden and sustained
changes in the applicable market conditions on the ensuing year's earnings,
based on year-end positions. The market changes, assumed to occur as of
year-end, are a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates, a 10 percent
strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus all other currencies, and a 10 percent
decline in the value of equity securities under management at AEFA. Computations
of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate, foreign exchange rate
and equity market changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative
levels of market interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices, as
well as the levels of assets and liabilities. The hypothetical changes and
assumptions will be different from what actually occurs in the future.
Furthermore, the computations do not incorporate actions that management could
take if the hypothetical market changes actually occur. As a result, actual
earnings consequences will differ from those quantified below.

TRS' hedging policies are established, maintained and monitored by the company's
treasury department. TRS generally manages its exposures along product lines. A
variety of interest rate and foreign exchange hedging strategies are employed to
manage interest rate and foreign currency risks.

TRS funds its Charge Card receivables and Cardmember loans using various funding
sources, such as long- and short-term debt, medium-term notes, commercial paper
and asset securitizations. Cardmember receivables are predominantly funded by
Credco and its subsidiaries; funding for Cardmember loans is primarily through
Centurion Bank. For its Charge Card and fixed rate lending products, interest
rate exposure is managed through the issuance of long- and short-term debt and
the use of interest rate swaps and, to a lesser extent, caps. During 2001, TRS
continued its strategy by augmenting its portfolio of interest rate swaps that
convert its domestic funding from floating rate to fixed rate. TRS regularly
reviews its strategy and may modify it. For the majority of its Cardmember
loans, which are linked to a floating rate base and generally reprice each
month, TRS uses floating rate funding.

The detrimental effect on TRS pretax earnings of a hypothetical 100 basis point
increase in interest rates would be approximately $48 million ($31 million
related to the U.S. dollar) and $80 million ($61 million related to the U.S.
dollar), based on 2001 and 2000 year-end positions, respectively. This effect is
primarily a function of the extent of variable rate funding of Charge Card and
fixed rate lending products, to the degree that interest rate exposure is not
managed by derivative financial instruments. With respect to the managed portion
of that interest rate exposure, a substantial amount of the $296 million of the
company's net after-tax unrealized losses recorded in other comprehensive income
on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2001 represents the fair value
of the related derivative financial instruments. These losses will be recognized
in earnings during the terms of those derivatives contracts at the same time
that the company realizes the benefits of lower market rates of interest on its
funding of Charge Card and fixed rate lending products. Notwithstanding the
unrealized losses, the company expects a year-over-year benefit from lower
interest rates in 2002 that is in excess of $400 million.

TRS' foreign exchange risk arising from cross-currency charges and balance sheet
exposures is managed primarily by entering into agreements to buy and sell
currencies on a spot or forward basis. Additionally, in the latter parts of 2001
and 2000, foreign currency forward sales (with notional amounts of $323 million
and $386 million, respectively) and, in the latter part of 2000, foreign
currency forward purchases (with notional amounts of $92 million) were
contracted to manage a portion of anticipated cash flows from operations in
major overseas markets for the subsequent year. In early 2002, the company
entered into additional forward contracts covering a substantial portion of the
remaining cash flows from operations.

Based on the year-end 2001 and 2000 foreign exchange positions, but excluding
the forward contracts managing the anticipated overseas operating results for
the subsequent year, the effect on TRS' earnings of a hypothetical 10 percent
strengthening of the U.S. dollar would be immaterial. With respect to the
forward contracts related to anticipated overseas operating results for the
subsequent year, a 10 percent strengthening would create hypothetical pretax
gains of $29 million and $27 million related to the 2001 and 2000 year-end
positions, respectively. Such gains, if any, would mitigate the negative effect
of a stronger U.S. dollar on overseas earnings for the subsequent year.

                                       6             (2001 Annual Report p. 33)

TRS' Argentine card business is a small part of its global card operations. In
December 2001 and January 2002, the Argentine government mandated the conversion
of dollar denominated assets into pesos and simultaneously devalued the peso.
This development has created a foreign exchange translation exposure that
previously did not exist with respect to TRS' Argentine operations. The
devaluation has been given effect in the financial statements as of December 31,
2001 by recording a loss of $49 million in "foreign currency translation
adjustments" in the shareholders' equity section of the consolidated balance
sheet. TRS is taking steps to manage this risk to the extent practicable and
efficient. The effect of the devaluation on the 2001 results of operations was
immaterial.

AEFA's owned investment securities are, for the most part, held by
its life insurance and investment certificate subsidiaries, which primarily
invest in long-term and intermediate-term fixed income securities to provide
their clients with a competitive rate of return on their investments while
controlling risk. Investment in fixed income securities is designed to provide
AEFA with a targeted margin between the interest rate earned on investments and
the interest rate credited to clients' accounts. AEFA does not invest in
securities to generate trading profits for its own account.

AEFA's life insurance and investment certificate subsidiaries' investment
committees regularly review models projecting various interest rate scenarios
and risk/return measures and their effect on the profitability of each
subsidiary. The committees' objectives are to structure their investment
security portfolios based upon the type and behavior of the products in the
liability portfolios to achieve targeted levels of profitability within defined
risk parameters and to meet contractual obligations.

Rates credited to customers' accounts are generally reset at shorter intervals
than the maturity of underlying investments. Therefore, AEFA's margins may be
affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. Part of the
committees' strategies include the use of derivatives, such as interest rate
caps, swaps and floors, for risk management purposes.

AEFA's fees earned on the management of fixed income securities in variable
annuities, variable insurance and mutual funds are generally based on the value
of the portfolios.

The negative effect on AEFA's pretax earnings of a 100 basis point increase in
interest rates, which assumes repricings and customer behavior based on the
application of proprietary models, to the book of business at December 31, 2001
and 2000, would be approximately $35 million and $44 million for 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

AEFA's fees earned on the management of equity securities in variable annuities,
variable insurance, mutual funds and other managed assets are generally based on
the value of the portfolios. AEFA writes and purchases index options to manage
the margin related to certain investment certificate and annuity products that
pay interest based upon the relative change in a major stock market index
between the beginning and end of the product's term. The negative effect on
AEFA's pretax earnings of a 10 percent decline in equity markets would be
approximately $81 million and $99 million based on assets under management,
certificate and annuity business in-force, and index options as of December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

AEB employs a variety of financial instruments in managing its exposure to
fluctuations in interest and currency rates. Derivative instruments consist
principally of foreign exchange spot and forward contracts, foreign currency
options, interest rate swaps, futures, and forward rate agreements. Generally,
they are used to manage specific interest rate and foreign exchange exposures
related to deposits, long-term debt, equity, loans and securities holdings.

The negative effect of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on AEB's
pretax earnings would be $18 million and $16 million as of December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively. The effect on earnings of a 10 percent strengthening of the
U.S. dollar would be negligible and, with respect to translation exposure of
foreign operations, would result in an $11 million and $10 million pretax charge
against equity as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

AEB utilizes foreign exchange and interest rate products to meet the needs of
its customers. Customer positions are usually, but not always, offset. They are
evaluated in terms of AEB's overall interest rate or foreign exchange exposure.
AEB also takes limited proprietary positions. Potential daily exposure from
trading activities is calculated using a Value at Risk methodology. This model
employs a parametric technique using a correlation matrix based on historical
data. The Value at Risk measure uses a 99 percent confidence interval to
estimate potential trading losses over a one-day period. At December 31, 2001
and 2000, the Value at Risk for AEB was less than $1 million.

                                       7             (2001 Annual Report p. 34)

Asset/liability and market risk management at AEB are supervised by the Asset
and Liability Committee, which comprises senior business managers of AEB. It
meets monthly and monitors: (i) liquidity, (ii) capital exposure, (iii) capital
adequacy, (iv) market risk and (v) investment portfolios. The committee
evaluates current market conditions and determines AEB's tactics within risk
limits approved by AEB's Board of Directors. AEB's treasury and risk management
issue policies and control procedures and delegate risk limits throughout AEB's
regional trading centers.

* EXCLUDES APPROXIMATELY $8 MILLION OF WAIVED FINANCE CHARGES AND LATE FEES
RECOGNIZED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2001.

Travel Related Services reported net income of $1.46 billion in 2001, a 24
percent decrease from $1.93 billion in 2000. Excluding restructuring charges of
$414 million ($267 million after-tax) and one-time costs and waived fees
directly related to the September 11th terrorist attacks of $87 million ($57
million after-tax), earnings were $1.78 billion, down 8 percent from last year.

In 2001, TRS' net revenues rose 4 percent as increased cards in force, growth in
Cardmember loans outstanding and higher fee revenue were partially offset by
relatively flat worldwide billed business and lower travel commissions and fees.
The 2001 performance reflects overall weakness in the economy, especially within
the travel and entertainment sectors. In 2000, TRS' net revenues benefited from
growth in worldwide billed business and Cardmember loans outstanding. Billed
business rose less than 1 percent

in 2001, after a 17 percent increase in 2000. The slower growth in worldwide
billings during 2001 was due primarily to significantly lower corporate card
spending in the travel and entertainment sector, particularly after the attacks
on September 11th. U.S. billed business increased 1 percent reflecting 6 percent
growth within the consumer card business on 12 percent higher transaction
volume, a 2 percent increase within small business services and an 11 percent
decline within Corporate Services. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange
translation, total billed business outside the U.S. rose approximately 3 percent
on growth in Europe and Asia, offset by declines in Canada and Latin America.
U.S. non-travel and entertainment related volume categories (which represented
approximately 60 percent of U.S. billed business during 2001) grew 9 percent
versus last year. U.S. travel and entertainment volume declined 9 percent.
Worldwide airline related volume declined 15 percent on high single digit
declines in both the average airline charge and transaction volumes. In 2000,
growth in billed business was due to higher average spending per basic
Cardmember and growth in cards-in-force. U.S. cards-in-force rose 4 percent and
11 percent in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The smaller increase during 2001
reflected more selective consumer card and small business acquisition activities
as the year progressed, in light of weakening economic conditions. International
cards-in-force increased 12 percent and 14 percent in 2001 and 2000,
respectively, due to growth in proprietary card products, as well as network
card growth.

Discount revenue fell 1 percent in 2001 as slight billed business growth was
offset by a lower discount rate. The decline in the discount rate from last year
reflects the cumulative impact of stronger than average growth in the lower rate
retail and other "everyday spend" merchant categories (eg., supermarkets,
discounters, etc.), as well as significantly weaker T&E spending during the
year. Conversely, discount revenue rose 15 percent in 2000 due to higher
worldwide billed business.

Net card fees increased slightly in 2001 and 2000, reflecting growth in
cards-in-force. Lending net finance charge revenue rose 32 percent and 23
percent in 2001 and 2000, respectively, from higher worldwide lending balances
and, in 2001, wider net interest margins. The wider margins were due to a
decrease in the proportion of the portfolio on introductory rates and the
benefit of lower funding costs, partially offset by the evolving mix of products
toward more lower-rate offerings. In 2000, the higher volume was partly offset
by a narrowing of net interest margins in the U.S. portfolio, as a greater
portion of the portfolio was on lower introductory rates, and relatively more
products were offered with fixed and lower rates.

Travel commissions and fees declined 16 percent in 2001 as a result of a 24
percent contraction in travel sales due to the effects of the September 11th
terrorist attacks and the weaker corporate travel environment throughout the
year. Travel commissions and fees increased only slightly in 2000, reflecting
the impact of the sale of an international leisure travel business. The
increases in other revenues in 2001 and 2000 include the effect of higher card
related fee income and larger insurance premiums.

Marketing and promotion expense declined 15 percent in 2001 as certain marketing
efforts were rationalized in light of the weaker business environment. Marketing
and promotion expense increased in 2000 reflecting higher media, card
acquisition and merchant-related advertising costs.

The worldwide Charge Card provision increased in both years due to higher
volumes and, in 2001, generally weaker economic and business conditions. The
worldwide lending provision rose in both 2001 and 2000, reflecting portfolio
growth and the natural maturation process for loans added over the past several
years. In 2001, the increase was also due to generally weaker economic and
business conditions, as unemployment and bankruptcies increased. Charge Card
interest expense rose in 2001 and 2000 as a result of higher borrowing rates
which, in 2001, were partly offset by lower billed business volumes.

In 2001, human resources expenses decreased as a result of a lower average
number of employees, reflecting ongoing reengineering efforts throughout the
year, lower levels of incentive compensation, and reduced contract programmer
expenses. Conversely, in 2000 human resources expense rose due to a higher
average number of employees and merit increases. In 2001, other operating
expenses rose due to Cardmember loyalty programs, business growth and lower
gains than the prior year, partially offset by reegineering activities and other
cost containment efforts. Similarly, in 2000, other operating expenses rose due
to increased Cardmember loyalty programs and business growth as well as greater
investment spending, partially offset by gains related to the sale of an
international leisure travel business and an investment in an internet company.

EFFECT OF SECURITIZATIONS
TRS securitizes loans, receivables and, to a limited extent, leases, in the
normal course of its business. The above statements of income and related
discussion present TRS results on a managed basis, as if there had been no loan
or receivable securitization transactions. See Note 6 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information regarding the company's
securitizations.

As discussed in Consolidated Liquidity and Capital Resources, one of TRS'
primary sources of funding is securitization of Cardmember loans and
receivables. TRS securitizes U.S. Cardmember loans and, in large part, transfers
the interests in those assets' cash flows to third party investors. TRS
continues to service the accounts and receives a fee for doing so; the fair
value and carrying amount of these future servicing fees, net of related costs,
are not material. Each new sale of securitized loans results in the removal of
the sold assets from the balance sheet, a reduction in a previously established
reserve for credit losses and the recognition of the present value of the future
net cash flows (i.e., finance charge income less interest paid to investors,
credit losses and servicing fees) related to the sold assets. This present value
amount represents a retained interest known as an interest-only strip. For the
securitized assets whose interests are not sold, the company retains the rights
to all their related cash flows. Those assets, therefore, are not taken off the
balance sheet and are known as seller's interests. In some instances, the
company, through affiliates, invests in subordinated interests issued by the
securitization trust; these are recorded as Investments classified as
Available-for-Sale.

The gain or loss recorded when loans are securitized is the difference between
the proceeds of sale and the book basis of the assets sold. That book basis is
determined by allocating the carrying amount of the assets, net of applicable
reserve for losses, between the assets sold and the retained interests based on
their relative fair values. Fair values are based on market prices at date of
transfer for assets sold and on the estimated present value of future cash flows
for retained interests.

On a GAAP reporting basis, TRS results included securitization gains of $155
million ($101 million after-tax) in 2001, $142 million ($92 million after-tax)
in 2000, and $154 million ($100 million after-tax) in 1999. These gains were
offset by expenses related to card acquisition initiatives and, therefore, had
no material impact on net income or total expenses in any year. The following
tables reconcile the TRS income statement from a managed basis to a GAAP basis.
These tables are not complete statements of income, as they include only those
income statement items that are affected by securitizations.

* EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF SFAS NO. 115 AND SFAS NO. 133. THE COMPANY ADOPTED
SFAS NO. 133 ON JANUARY 1, 2001.

The American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Trust) securitized $4.3
billion and $4.0 billion of loans in 2001 and 2000, respectively, through the
public issuance of investor certificates. During 2001, $1.0 billion of investor
certificates that were previously issued by the Trust matured, resulting in $3.3
billion of net additional securitizations during the year. There were no
certificate maturities in 2000. The securitized assets consist of loans arising
in a portfolio of designated consumer American Express credit card, Optima Line
of Credit and Sign & Travel/Extended Payment Option revolving credit accounts or
features owned by American Express Centurion Bank (Centurion Bank), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of TRS, and, in the future, may include other charge or
credit accounts or features or products. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, TRS had
a total of $14.3 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively, of Trust-related
securitized loans which are not on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In early
2002, the company securitized an additional $920 million of loans.

Under the terms of the Trust pooling and servicing agreement, the occurrence of
certain events, or triggers, could result in the Trust being required to pay
down the investor certificates before their expected payment dates over an early
amortization period. Examples of these events include: the failure or the
decline of the securitized assets to generate specified yields over a defined
period of time, and the decline of the total of the securitized assets'
principal balances below a specified percentage of total investor certificates
outstanding after the failure to add additional securitized assets as required
by the agreement. The company does not expect an early amortization event to
occur. In the event of a pay-down, $13.1 billion of assets ($14.3 billion
securitized less $1.2 billion retained subordinated interests) would come back
on-balance sheet and an alternate source of funding of a commensurate amount
would have to be obtained. Had a total pay-down hypothetically occurred at a
single point in time at December 31, 2001, the one-time negative effect on
results of operations would have been approximately $600 million pretax,
reflecting approximately $445 million of additional reserve for credit losses
related to the $14.3 billion of Cardmember loans that would come back on the
balance sheet, plus $155 million of final amortization of the interest-only
strip.

The American Express Master Trust (the Master Trust) securitizes Charge Card
receivables generated under designated American Express Card, Gold Card and
Platinum Card consumer accounts through the issuance of trust certificates. In
both 2001 and 2000, $600 million of accounts receivable trust certificates that
were previously issued by the Master Trust matured from the Charge Card
securitization portfolio. In 2001, the Master Trust securitized $750 million of
Charge Card receivables which remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In
early 2002, the Master Trust securitized an additional $750 million of Charge
Card receivables, which also remain on the balance sheet. As a result of the
company's adoption of SFAS No. 140 during 2001, as further discussed in Note 1
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, TRS had securitized receivables of
$3.0 billion on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2001; whereas at
December 31, 2000, TRS' $2.85 billion of comparable securitized receivables were
not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Master Trust specifies
events, the occurrence of which would result in a pay-down. The company does not
expect a pay-down to occur. While virtually no financial statement impact would
result from a pay-down, as the assets are already on-balance sheet, an alternate
source of funding for $3.0 billion of receivables would have to be obtained.

                                      13             (2001 Annual Report p. 40)

Further, with respect to both the American Express Credit Account Master Trust
and the American Express Master Trust, a decline in the actual or implied
short-term credit rating of TRS below A-1/P-1 will trigger a requirement that
TRS, as servicer, transfer collections on the securitized assets to investors on
a daily, rather than a monthly, basis or make alternative arrangements with the
rating agencies so as to allow TRS to continue to transfer collections on a
monthly basis. Examples of such alternative arrangements include obtaining
appropriate guaranties for the performance of the payment and deposit
obligations of TRS, as servicer.

TRS also securitizes equipment lease receivables. At December 31, 2001 and 2000,
the amount sold and outstanding to third party investors was $675 million and
$242 million, respectively. These sales result in a reduction of interest
expense and provisions for losses, as well as servicing revenue, all of which
are insignificant to the company's results of operations.

In 2000, Credco called $150 million 1.125% Cash Exchangeable Notes due 2003. The
notes were exchangeable for an amount in cash which was linked to the price of
the common shares of the company. Credco had entered into agreements to fully
hedge its obligations. Accordingly, the related hedging agreements were called
at the same time.

TRS, primarily through Credco, maintained commercial paper outstanding of
approximately $18.0 billion at an average interest rate of 1.9% and
approximately $20.4 billion at an average interest rate of 6.4% at December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively. Unused lines of credit of approximately $10.4
billion, which expire in increments from 2002 through 2006, were available at
December 31, 2001 to support a portion of TRS' commercial paper borrowings.

Borrowings under bank lines of credit totaled $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

In early 2002, Credco issued an aggregate of $1.4 billion of medium-term notes
at fixed and floating rates with maturities of one to three years.

American Express Financial Advisors reported a 95 percent decline in net income
in 2001. Included in these results are restructuring charges of $107 million
($70 million after-tax) and insurance claims of $11 million ($8 million
after-tax) directly related to the September 11th terrorist attacks. The
restructuring charge primarily reflects severance for the elimination of
approximately 1,300 jobs and costs related to facility consolidation. Excluding
these items, net income would have been $130 million, an 87 percent decrease
from a year ago. In addition, during the first half of 2001 AEFA incurred $1.01
billion in charges ($669 million after-tax) from the write down and sale of some
high-yield securities and from reducing risk within its investment portfolio.
Net revenues fell 33 percent in 2001 due to lower spreads on investment
portfolio products, reduced management and distribution fees and the high-yield
losses noted above. Net revenues and net income in 2000 increased 13 percent and
10 percent, respectively, over 1999 levels. These results reflected higher fees
due to growth in average managed assets and product sales, partially offset by
the effect of narrower spreads on the investment portfolio. The spreads included
a $123 million pretax ($88 million after-tax) charge to write down high-yield
securities.

Management and distribution fees declined 13 percent in 2001 due to lower
average assets under management and weaker sales, particularly in mutual fund
products, reflecting the negative impact of weak equity market conditions
throughout the year. Conversely, in comparing 2000 with 1999, management and
distribution fees increased 24 percent due to greater management fee revenue
from higher average assets under management, positive net sales and net
year-over-year benefits from equity fee hedges. Investment income decreased in
both 2001 and 2000. Both years benefited from growth in average investments,
although this was more than offset by the high-yield losses mentioned earlier
and from the decrease in the value of options hedging the outstanding stock
market certificates, which are offset in the certificate provisions. Lower
average yields, primarily due to the portfolio repositioning, also contributed
to the decline in investment income during 2001. Other revenues rose in both
years from increased life and property-casualty insurance premiums and charges
and from higher financial planning fees. Starting in 2000, franchise fees from
Platform 2 advisors (those that operate as independent contractors under the
American Express brand) were collected and have been included in other revenues.
The provision for losses and benefits for annuities declined due to lower fixed
annuities in-force in both years; 2001 also benefited from lower accrual rates,
while in 2000, higher accrual rates partially offset the decline. Insurance
provisions rose in 2001 and 2000, reflecting higher in-force levels in both
years and greater accrual rates in 2000. Investment certificate provisions
decreased in 2001 as higher in-force levels were offset by lower accrual rates.
In 2000, investment certificate provisions rose due to both higher in-force
levels and accrual rates. In both years, investment certificate provisions were
decreased by the impact of depreciation in the S&P 500 on the stock market
certificate product.

Human resources expenses declined in 2001, reflecting lower field force
compensation-related expenses due to the decline in advisors and the impact of
lower volumes on advisor compensation, as well as the benefits of reengineering
and cost containment initiatives within the home office where the average number
of employees was down 7 percent from last year. In 2000, human resources
expenses rose due to higher advisor compensation from growth in sales volumes
and asset levels and a greater number of advisors and employees; additionally
the increase in 2000 reflected costs related to the new advisor platforms. Other
operating expenses increased in both years. In 2001, the increase reflects
accelerated investing activities for various strategic, reengineering,
technology and product development projects and a higher minority interest
related to a joint venture with AEB. In 2000, the increase was due to costs
related to higher business volumes and the implementation of the new advisor
platforms, including greater rent and equipment support costs. In both 2001 and
2000, human resources and other operating expenses included higher amortization
of DAC for variable insurance and annuity products.

* EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF SFAS NO. 115 AND SFAS NO. 133. THE COMPANY ADOPTED
SFAS NO. 133 ON JANUARY 1, 2001.

AEFA's total assets and liabilities decreased in both 2001 and 2000 due to
declines in separate account assets and liabilities as a result of market
depreciation, partly offset by positive net sales. Investments are comprised
primarily of corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities, including $1.3
billion and $3.7 billion in below investment grade debt securities, and $4.0
billion and $4.1 billion in mortgage loans at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Non-performing assets relative to invested assets were

                                      16             (2001 Annual Report p. 43)




<Page>

0.1% and 0.9% at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Investments are
principally funded by sales of insurance, annuities and certificates and by
reinvested income. Maturities of these investments are largely matched with the
expected future payments of insurance and annuity obligations.

During 2001 the company placed a majority of its rated CDO securities and
related accrued interest, as well as a relatively minor amount of other liquid
securities (collectively referred to as transferred assets), having an aggregate
book value of $905 million, into a securitization trust. In return, the company
received $120 million in cash (excluding transaction expenses) relating to sales
to unaffiliated investors and retained interests with allocated book amounts
aggregating $785 million. The company has no obligations, contingent or
otherwise, to such unaffiliated investors. One of the results of this
transaction is that increases and decreases in future cash flows of the
individual CDOs are combined into one overall cash flow for purposes of
determining the carrying value of the retained interests and related impact on
results of operations.

AEFA's client contract reserves are for current and future obligations related
to fixed annuities, investment certificates, and life and disability insurance.
The obligations for fixed annuities, universal life contracts and investment
certificates are based on the underlying contract accumulation values. The
obligations for other traditional life insurance products are based on various
assumptions, including mortality rates, morbidity rates and policy persistency.
To the extent that actual future experience differs with respect to other
traditional life insurance products, these reserves would be adjusted through
the provision for losses and benefits.

Separate account assets, primarily investments carried at market value, and
liabilities represent funds held for the exclusive benefit of variable annuity
and variable life insurance contract holders. AEFA earns investment management,
administration and other fees from the related accounts.

In light of the investment losses recorded during the first half of 2001, AEFA
received a capital contribution of $490 million from the Parent Company during
the year.

American Express Bank reported a net loss of $13 million in 2001, compared with
net income of $29 million in 2000. Excluding restructuring charges of $96
million ($65 million after-tax), 2001 net income would have been $52 million, an
82 percent increase from 2000. Net revenues rose 10 percent in 2001, reflecting
strong performance in Personal Finance Services (PFS) and Private Banking,
partially offset by lower revenue from Corporate Banking activities as the
company continues to shift its business focus away from that sector. In 2000,
net revenues declined 5 percent.

Net interest income in 2001 increased from a year ago due to higher consumer
loans and the effects of lower funding costs, partially offset by decreases in
corporate banking volumes. In 2000, net interest income declined, primarily due
to the effects of higher funding costs. In 2001, commissions and fees decreased
due to lower results in corporate banking, and lower mutual fund fees within the
financial institution business, partially offset by higher loan volumes in PFS.
In 2000, commissions and fees increased, reflecting growth in private banking,
PFS, and the financial institution business. In 2001, foreign exchange income
and other revenue increased due to higher income from a joint venture with AEFA,
partially offset by lower corporate banking revenue and other joint venture
income. In 2000, foreign exchange income and other revenues declined from the
prior year as a result of lower securities gains and joint venture income.

Human resources and other operating expenses declined in both years, reflecting
reengineering savings and the benefits of lower employee levels, as AEB
continued to rationalize certain country activities. Provision for losses
increased substantially in 2001 primarily due to higher PFS loan volumes.

** EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF SFAS NO. 115 AND SFAS NO. 133. THE COMPANY ADOPTED
SFAS NO. 133 ON JANUARY 1, 2001.

                                      18             (2001 Annual Report p. 45)




<Page>

AEB had approximately $5.3 billion outstanding in worldwide loans at December
31, 2001 and 2000. Current year activities included a $900 million decrease in
corporate banking loans, as AEB continued to focus on reducing exposure in this
activity while emphasizing consumer and private banking loans, which rose by
$800 million ($1.0 billion excluding the effect of asset sales and
securitizations in the consumer loan portfolio). In addition, financial
institution loans decreased by $100 million. Other banking activities, such as
securities, unrealized gains on foreign exchange and derivatives contracts,
various contingencies and market placements added approximately $7.3 billion and
$7.4 billion to AEB's credit exposures at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. In December 2001 and January 2002, the Argentine government
mandated the conversion of dollar denominated assets into pesos and
simultaneously devalued the peso. AEB's credit exposures to Argentina at
December 31, 2001 were $56 million, which includes loans of $25 million.

CORPORATE AND OTHER

Corporate and Other reported net expenses of $187 million, $180 million and $174
million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 2001 results include $14 million
pretax ($9 million after-tax) of the restructuring charges noted earlier.

Results for 2001, 2000 and 1999 include a $46 million pretax ($39 million
after-tax) preferred stock dividend based on earnings from Lehman Brothers. The
dividend was offset by business building initiatives in each year, and costs
related to the Y2K issue in 1999.

OTHER REPORTING MATTERS

ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets," effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Under the
new rules, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will
no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests. The
company adopted the new rules as of January 1, 2002. As a result, goodwill is no
longer being amortized. The impact on the company's net income in 2001 and 2000
from goodwill amortization was $106 million ($82 million after-tax) and $98
million ($77 million after-tax), respectively. While the company is currently
evaluating the provisions of the new rules related to impairment testing, it
does not expect that such tests will result in any material effect on the
company's results of operations or financial position.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations." This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the
associated asset retirement costs. The company is required to adopt SFAS No. 143
as of January 1, 2003. The adoption of this Statement is not expected to have a
material impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which supercedes FASB No. 121, "Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of." This new Statement also supercedes certain aspects of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations--Reporting the
Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions," with regard to reporting the
effects of a disposal of a segment of a business. The new rule requires
operating losses from discontinued operations to be reported in future periods,
as incurred. In addition, businesses below the operating segment level may
qualify for discontinued operations treatment. The company adopted the
provisions of the Statement as of January 1, 2002, which will primarily affect
the company if and when qualifying future business dispositions occur.

"could," and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking
statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are
made. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any
forward-looking statements. In addition to those described elsewhere in this
Report, factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: fluctuation in the
equity markets, which can affect the amount and types of investment products
sold by AEFA, the market value of its managed assets, and management and
distribution fees received based on those assets; potential deterioration in the
high-yield sector and other investment areas, which could result in further
losses in AEFA's investment portfolio; the ability of AEFA to sell certain
high-yield investments at expected values and within anticipated timeframes and
to maintain its high-yield portfolio at certain levels in the future;
developments relating to AEFA's new platform structure for financial advisors,
including the ability to increase advisor productivity, moderate the growth of
new advisors and create efficiencies in the infrastructure; AEFA's ability to
roll out new and attractive products in a timely manner and effectively manage
the economics in selling a growing volume of non-proprietary products;
investment performance in AEFA's businesses; the success, timeliness and
financial impact, including costs, cost savings and other benefits of
reengineering initiatives being implemented or considered by the company,
including cost management, structural and strategic measures such as vendor,
process, facilities and operations consolidation, outsourcing, relocating
certain functions to lower cost overseas locations, moving internal and external
functions to the Internet to save costs, the scale-back of corporate lending in
certain regions, and planned staff reductions relating to certain of such
reengineering actions; the ability to control and manage operating,
infrastructure, advertising and promotion and other expenses as business expands
or changes, including balancing the need for longer-term investment spending;
the impact on the company's businesses and uncertainty created by the September
11th terrorist attacks, and the potential negative effect on the company of any
such attacks in the future; the company's ability to recover under its insurance
policies for losses resulting from the September 11th terrorist attacks;
consumer and business spending on the company's travel related services
products, particularly credit and charge cards and growth in card lending
balances, which depend in part on the ability to issue new and enhanced card
products and increase revenues from such products, attract new Cardholders,
capture a greater share of existing Cardholders' spending, sustain premium
discount rates, increase merchant coverage, retain Cardmembers after low
introductory lending rates have expired, and expand the global network services
business; the ability to execute the company's global corporate services
strategy including greater penetration of middle market companies, increasing
capture of non-T&E spending through greater use of the company's purchasing card
and other means, and further globalizing business capabilities; successfully
expanding the company's on-line and off-line distribution channels and
cross-selling financial, travel, card and other products and services to its
customer base, both in the U.S. and abroad; effectively leveraging the company's
assets, such as its brand, customers and international presence in the Internet
environment; investing in and competing at the leading edge of technology across
all businesses; a downturn in the company's businesses and/or negative changes
in the company's and its subsidiaries' credit ratings which could result in
contingent payments under contracts, decreased liquidity and higher borrowing
costs; increasing competition in all of the company's major businesses;
fluctuations in interest rates, which impact the company's borrowing costs,
return on lending products and spreads in the investment and insurance
businesses; credit trends and the rate of bankruptcies, which can affect
spending on card products, debt payments by individual and corporate customers
and businesses that accept the company's card products and returns on the
company's investment portfolios; foreign currency exchange rates; political or
economic instability in certain regions or countries, which could affect
commercial and other lending activities, among other businesses; legal and
regulatory developments, such as in the areas of consumer privacy and data
protection; acquisitions; and outcomes in litigation. A further description of
these and other risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most
recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the SEC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
American Express Company and its subsidiaries (the company). All significant
intercompany transactions are eliminated.

AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
Accounting estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial
statements. In part they are based upon assumptions concerning future events.
Among the more significant are those which relate to reserves for Cardmember
credit losses, MEMBERSHIP REWARDS, the recognition of other than temporary
impairment within the investment portfolio (see Note 4) and the amortization of
deferred acquisition costs. These reflect the best judgment of management and
actual results could differ.

REVENUES
Cardmember lending net finance charge revenue is presented net of interest
expense of $953 million, $1,039 million and $674 million for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Interest and dividends is
presented net of interest expense related primarily to the company's
international banking activities of $434 million, $559 million and $453 million
for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

RESERVES FOR CREDIT LOSSES
Reserves for credit losses related to Cardmember loans and receivables are
primarily based upon statistically driven models derived from historical
experience, as well as management judgment as to the business and economic
environment. In determining the reserves, management evaluates both internal
credit metrics, such as migration analysis, write-off rates, recovery rates and
net write-off coverage, as well as external economic data, such as unemployment,
bankruptcy filings and consumer confidence, among other indicators that may
impact the portfolios.

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS
The company's MEMBERSHIP REWARDS Loyalty Program allows Cardmembers to earn
points that can be redeemed for a broad range of travel rewards, retail
merchandise and gourmet gifts. The company makes payments to merchants when
Cardmembers redeem their points and establishes reserves in connection with such
redemptions. The provision for the cost of MEMBERSHIP REWARDS is based upon
points awarded in the current year which are ultimately expected to be redeemed
by program members and the current average cost per point of redemption. The
cumulative liability for unredeemed points is adjusted over time based on actual
experience and current trends with respect to redemptions.

DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS
American Express Financial Advisors' (AEFA) deferred acquisition costs (DAC)
represent costs of acquiring new business, principally sales and other
distribution and underwriting costs, that have been deferred on the sale of
annuity, insurance, and certain mutual fund and other long-term products. DACs
are amortized over the lives of the products, either as a constant percentage of
projected earnings or as a constant percentage of the projected liabilities
associated with such products. Such projections require the use of certain
assumptions, including interest margins, mortality rates, persistency rates,
maintenance expense levels and, for variable products, separate account
performance. As actual experience differs from the current assumptions,
management considers on a quarterly basis the need to change key assumptions
underlying the amortization models prospectively. For example, if the stock
market trend rose or declined appreciably, it could impact assumptions made
about separate account performance and result in an adjustment to income, either
positively or negatively. The impact on results of operations of changing
prospective assumptions with respect to the amortization of DACs is reflected in
the period in which such changes are made.

                                      25             (2001 Annual Report p. 52)




<Page>

MARKETING AND PROMOTION
The company expenses advertising costs in the year in which the advertising
first takes place.

SEPARATE ACCOUNT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Separate account assets and liabilities are funds held for the exclusive benefit
of variable annuity and variable life insurance contract holders. The company
receives investment management fees, mortality and expense assurance fees,
minimum death benefit guarantee fees and cost of insurance charges from the
related accounts.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
At December 31, 2001 and 2000, cash and cash equivalents included $1.0 billion
and $1.2 billion, respectively, segregated in special bank accounts for the
benefit of customers. The company has defined cash equivalents to include time
deposits with original maturities of 90 days or less.

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Effective January 1, 2001, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities," which requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either
assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair
value. Changes in the fair value of a derivative are recorded in earnings or
directly to equity, depending on the instrument's designated use. The adoption
of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a cumulative after-tax reduction to other
comprehensive income of $120 million. See Note 10 for further discussion of the
company's derivatives and hedging activities.

Effective April 1, 2001, the company adopted SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,"
which clarified accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing
of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities, as well as the
recognition and reclassification of collateral. SFAS No. 140 did not materially
impact the company's securitized U.S. Cardmember loans and equipment lease
receivables. The company's Charge Card receivables securitization structure did
not meet certain sale criteria of SFAS 140. As a result, approximately $3.1
billion of Charge Card receivables (which had also been securitized as of
December 31, 2000) and a related amount of long-term debt were reinstated to the
balance sheet. While the Charge Card receivables and associated long-term debt
reappeared on the Consolidated Financial Statements, these securitized assets
are not available to creditors of the company and are not the assets of the
company, and the company has no liability for securities issued by
securitization trusts. The impact of this adoption on results of operations was
immaterial. In addition, there was no impact on capital requirements. See Note 6
for further discussion of the company's securitized loans and receivables.

In July 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF) issued a consensus on Issue 99-20, "Recognition of Interest Income
and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized
Financial Assets" (Issue 99-20), which prescribed new procedures for recording
interest income and measuring impairment on retained and purchased beneficial
interests. The rule, which the company adopted on January 1, 2001, primarily
affected certain AEFA structured investments. See Note 4 for further discussion
of the company's investments.

NOTE 2 - RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

In the third and fourth quarters of 2001, as a result of accelerating certain
reengineering initiatives, the company incurred restructuring charges of $352
million ($232 million after-tax) and $279 million ($179 million after-tax),
respectively, resulting in total charges of $631 million ($411 million
after-tax) for the full year. The fourth quarter pretax charge includes $185
million for severance relating to the elimination of approximately 6,800 jobs,
and $94 million of other charges primarily relating to the consolidation of real
estate facilities. The third quarter pretax charge includes $184 million for
severance relating to the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs. It also
includes $26 million recorded in "Provisions for losses and benefits--Life
insurance, international banking and other" on the Consolidated Statements of
Income, and relates to plans to further scale back American Express

Bank's (AEB) corporate lending activities in parts of Asia, Latin America and
Europe as well as $142 million of other charges, including asset impairment
charges and other exit costs relating to the exit of certain locations and $24
million of currency translation losses previously recorded in shareholders'
equity. As of December 31, 2001, other liabilities include $460 million for the
expected future cash outlays related to these charges. The pretax charge and
employee reductions by operating segment are as follows:

NOTE 3 - DISASTER RECOVERY CHARGE

As a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the company incurred
a $90 million ($59 million after-tax) disaster recovery charge. This charge
mainly includes provisions for credit exposures to travel industry service
establishments and insurance claims. $79 million of the pretax charge was
incurred by Travel Related Services (TRS), while $11 million was incurred by
AEFA. In addition to the pretax charge, the company waived approximately $8
million of finance charges and late fees.

The company also incurred costs of approximately $58 million since September
11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance and, consequently, did not
impact results. These include the cost of duplicate facilities and equipment
associated with the relocation of the company's offices in lower Manhattan and
certain other business recovery expenses. Costs associated with the damage to
the company's offices, extra operating expenses and business interruption losses
are still being evaluated. As of January 2002, approximately $30 million of such
costs relating to the company's portion of the repair of its headquarters
building have been identified. The company expects that a substantial portion of
these losses will be covered by insurance.

Generally, investment securities are carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
Gains and losses are recognized in the results of operations upon disposition of
the securities. In addition, losses are also recognized when management
determines that a decline in value is not temporary, which requires judgment
regarding the amount and timing of recovery. Typically, the company defines an
event of impairment for debt securities as issuer default or bankruptcy. Fair
value is generally based on quoted market prices. However, the company's
investment portfolio also contains structured investments of various asset
quality, including Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) and Structured Loan
Trusts (backed by high-yield bonds and bank loans, respectively) which are not

readily marketable. As a result, the carrying values of these structured
investments are based on cash flow projections which require a significant
degree of judgment and as such are subject to change.

Investments classified as Held-to-Maturity were sold during 2000 due to credit
deterioration. Gross realized gains and losses on sales were negligible.

Gross realized gains and (losses) on sales of securities classified as
Available-for-Sale, using the specific identification method, were $322
million and ($1,035 million), including the effect of the sale of high-yield
securities discussed below, $170 million and ($47 million) and $64 million and
($23 million) for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

The increase in net unrealized gains on Trading securities, which is included in
income, was $16 million, $16 million and $30 million for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

During the first half of 2001, the company recognized pretax losses of $1.01
billion ($182 million and $826 million in the first and second quarters,
respectively) from the write down and sale of certain high-yield securities.
These losses are included in interest and dividends on the Consolidated
Statements of Income. The second quarter pretax charge of $826 million is
comprised of: $403 million to recognize the impact of higher default rate
assumptions on certain structured investments; $344 million to write down
lower-rated securities (most of which were sold in the third quarter of 2001) in
connection with the company's decision to lower its risk profile by reducing the
level of its high-yield portfolio, allocating holdings toward stronger credits,
and reducing the concentration of exposure to individual companies and industry
sectors; and $79 million to write down certain other investments to recognize
losses incurred during the second quarter.

Subsequently, during 2001 the company placed a majority of its rated
Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) (obligations of various credit ratings that
are backed by high-yield bonds) securities and related accrued interest, as well
as a relatively minor amount of other liquid securities (collectively referred
to as transferred assets), having an aggregate book value of $905 million, into
a securitization trust. In return, the company received $120 million in cash
(excluding transaction expenses) relating to sales to unaffiliated investors and
retained interests with allocated book amounts aggregating $785 million. The
book amount is determined by allocating the previous carrying value of the
transferred assets between assets sold and the retained interests based on their
relative fair values. Fair values are based on the estimated present value of
future cash flows. The retained interests are accounted for in accordance with
EITF Issue 99-20.

In connection with the spin-off of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) in
1994, the company acquired 928 shares and Nippon Life Insurance company (Nippon
Life) acquired 72 shares of Lehman's redeemable voting preferred stock for a
nominal dollar amount. This security entitles its holders to receive an
aggregate annual dividend of 50 percent of Lehman's net income in excess of $400
million for each of eight years ending in May 2002, with a maximum dividend of
$50 million in any one year. In each of the three years ended December 31, 2001,
the company received a pretax dividend of $46 million on these shares.

The change in net unrealized securities gains (losses) recognized in other
comprehensive loss includes two components: (1) unrealized gains (losses) that
arose from changes in market value of securities that were held during the
period (holding gains (losses)), and (2) gains (losses) that were previously
unrealized, but have been recognized in current period net income due to sales
of Available-for-Sale securities (reclassification for realized gains). This
reclassification has no effect on total comprehensive loss or shareholders'
equity.

tax:

NOTE 6 - SECURITIZED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES

The company, through TRS, securitizes U.S. Cardmember loans and, in large part,
subsequently transfers the interests in those assets' cash flows to third party
investors. The company continues to service the accounts and receives a fee for
doing so; the fair value and carrying amount of these future servicing fees, net
of related costs, are not material. Each new sale of securitized loans results
in the removal of the sold assets from the balance sheet, a reduction in a
previously established reserve for credit losses and the recognition of the
present value of the future net cash flows (i.e., finance charge income less
interest paid to investors, credit losses and servicing fees) related to the
sold assets. This present value amount represents a retained interest known as
an interest-only strip. For the securitized assets whose interests are not sold,
the company retains the rights to all their related cash flows. Those assets,
therefore, are not taken off the balance sheet and are known as seller's
interests. In some instances, the company, through affiliates, invests in
subordinated interests issued by the securitization trust; these are recorded as
Investments classified as Available-for-Sale.

The gain or loss recorded when loans are securitized is the difference between
the proceeds of sale and the book basis of the assets sold. That book basis is
determined by allocating the carrying amount of the assets, net of applicable
reserve for losses, between the assets sold and the retained interests based on
their relative fair values. Fair values are based on market prices at date of
transfer for assets sold and on the estimated present value of future cash flows
for retained interests.

During 2001, 2000 and 1999, the company sold $4.3 billion, $4.0 billion and $4.0
billion, respectively, of U.S. Cardmember loans, or $3.9 billion, $3.6 billion
and $3.7 billion net of investments in subordinated interests. During 2001, $1.0
billion of investor certificates that were previously issued by the
securitization trust matured, resulting in $3.3 billion of net additional
securitizations during the year. There were no certificate maturities in 2000.
The pretax gains on these securitizations were $155 million, $142 million and
$154 million, respectively. Cash flows from interest-only strips as well as
servicing revenue, which is 2 percent of principal, are recorded in other
revenues. As of December 31, 2001, $13.1 billion of U.S. Cardmember loans had
been sold, net of investments in subordinated interests of $1.2 billion.

The value of retained interests is primarily subject to changes in credit risk,
average loan life and interest rates on the transferred financial assets. Key
economic assumptions used in measuring the retained interests resulting from
securitizations during 2001 and 2000 were as follows (rates are per annum):

At December 31, 2001 and 2000, interest-only strips were $155 million and $272
million, respectively.

The key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current year's fair
value to immediate 10 percent and 20 percent adverse changes in assumed
economics are as follows:

</Table>

These sensitivities are hypothetical and will be different from what actually
occurs in the future. As the figures indicate, any change in fair value based on
a 10 percent variation in assumptions cannot be extrapolated because the
relationship of the change in assumption on the fair value of the retained
interest is calculated independent from any change in another assumption; in
reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which magnify
or counteract the sensitivities.

The company also securitizes equipment lease receivables. At December 31, 2001
and 2000, the amount sold and outstanding to third party investors was $675
million and $242 million, respectively. These sales result in a reduction of
interest expense and provisions for losses, as well as servicing revenue, all of
which are insignificant to the company's results of operations.

NOTE 7 - SHORT- AND LONG-TERM DEBT AND BORROWING AGREEMENTS

SHORT-TERM DEBT
At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the company's total short-term debt outstanding
was $31.6 billion and $36.0 billion, respectively, with weighted average
interest rates of 3.0% and 6.5%, respectively. At December 31, 2001 and 2000,
$17.1 billion and $9.7 billion, respectively, of short-term debt outstanding was
covered by interest rate swaps. The year-end weighted average effective interest
rates were 4.6% and 6.4% for 2001 and 2000, respectively. The company generally
paid fixed rates of interest under the terms of interest rate swaps. Unused
lines of credit to support commercial paper borrowings were approximately $10.4
billion and $9.7 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

NOTE 8 - CUMULATIVE QUARTERLY INCOME PREFERRED SHARES

In 1998, American Express Company Capital Trust I, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the company, established as a Delaware statutory business trust (the
Trust), completed a public offering of 20 million shares (carrying value of
$500 million) of 7.0% Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Shares Series I
(QUIPS) (liquidation preference of $25 per share). Proceeds of the issue were
invested in Junior Subordinated Debentures (the Debentures) issued by the
company due 2028, which represent the sole assets of the Trust. The QUIPS are
subject to mandatory redemption upon repayment of the Debentures at maturity
or their earlier redemption. The company has the option to redeem the
Debentures, in whole or in part, at any time on or after July 16, 2003, which
will result in the redemption of a corresponding amount of QUIPS.

The company has unconditionally guaranteed all distributions required to be
made by the Trust, but only to the extent the Trust has funds legally
available for such distributions. The only source of funds for the Trust is
the company's interest payments on the Debentures. The company has the right
to defer such interest payments up to 20 consecutive quarters; as a
consequence, quarterly dividend payments on the QUIPS can be deferred by the
Trust during any such interest payment period. If the company defers any
interest payments, the company may not, among other things, pay any dividends
on its capital stock until all interest in arrears is paid to the Trust.
Distributions on the QUIPS are reported as Interest Expense in the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

NOTE 9 - COMMON AND PREFERRED SHARES

In September 1998, the company's Board of Directors authorized the company to
repurchase up to 120 million additional common shares over the subsequent two
to three years, subject to market conditions. The company has repurchased
approximately 357 million shares since 1994 pursuant to several
authorizations, including 57 million under the current authorization
(including the 8 million shares delivered to the company during 2001 as a
result of the prepayment discussed below). These plans are designed to allow
the company to purchase shares, both to offset the issuance of new shares as
part of employee compensation plans and to reduce shares outstanding.

Of the common shares authorized but unissued at December 31, 2001, 164
million shares were reserved for issuance for employee stock, employee
benefit and dividend reinvestment plans, as well as stock purchase
agreements.

In 1999 and 2000, the company entered into agreements under which a third
party purchased 29 million company common shares at an average purchase price
of $50.41 per share. These agreements, which partially offset the company's
exposure from its stock option program, are separate from the company's
previously authorized share repurchase program. During the term of these
agreements, the company will periodically issue shares to or receive shares
from the third party so that the value of the shares held by the third party
equals the original purchase price for the shares. At maturity in five years,
the company is required to deliver to the third party an amount equal to such
original purchase price. The company may elect to settle this amount (i)
physically, by paying cash against delivery of the shares held by the third
party or (ii) on a net cash or net share basis. The company may also prepay
outstanding amounts at any time prior to the end of the five-year term. In
2001, the company elected to prepay $350 million of the aggregate outstanding
amount, which resulted in 8 million shares being delivered to the company. Net
settlements under these agreements resulted in the company issuing 12 million
shares in 2001 and receiving 2 million shares in 2000.

Common shares activity for each of the last three years ended December 31 was:

NOTE 10 - DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

As prescribed by SFAS No. 133, derivative instruments that are designated and
qualify as hedging instruments are further classified as either a cash flow
hedge, a fair value hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation,
based upon the exposure being hedged.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge,
the portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument effective at
offsetting changes in the hedged item is reported as a component of other
comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings when the hedged
transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the
derivative instrument is recognized currently in earnings. For derivative
instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or
loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in current earnings
during the period of the change in fair values. For derivative instruments that
are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
operation, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is
reported in other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative
translation adjustment. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging
instruments, the gain or loss is recognized currently in earnings.

CASH FLOW HEDGES
The company uses interest rate products, primarily swaps, to manage funding
costs related to TRS' Charge Card business, as well as AEFA's investment
certificate business. For its Charge Card products, TRS uses interest rate swaps
to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and floating rate funding. These interest
rate swaps are used to protect the company from the interest rate risk that
arises from short-term funding. AEFA uses interest rate products to hedge the
risk of rising interest rates on investment certificates which reset at shorter
intervals than the average maturity of the investment portfolio.

At December 31, 2001, the company expects to reclassify $208 million of net
pretax losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) to earnings during the next twelve months. These losses will be
recognized in earnings during the terms of those derivatives contracts at the
same time that the company realizes the benefits of lower market rates of
interest on its funding of Charge Card and fixed rate lending products.

Currently, the longest period of time over which the company is hedging exposure
to the variability in future cash flows is 5 years and relates to funding of
foreign currency denominated receivables.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES
The company uses derivatives to hedge against the change in
fair value of some of its investments in public companies. Changes in the fair
value of the derivatives are recorded in earnings along with related designated
changes in the spot price of the underlying shares. Changes in the time value
elements of these derivatives are considered as hedge ineffectiveness.

The company also uses interest rate swaps to hedge its firm commitments to
transfer, at a fixed rate, receivables to trusts established in connection with
its asset securitizations. AEFA is exposed to interest rate risk associated with
its fixed rate corporate bond investments. AEFA enters into interest rate swaps
to hedge the risk of changing interest rates as investment certificates reset at
shorter intervals than the average maturity of the investment portfolio.

During 2001, the company recognized a pretax net loss of $1.2 million primarily
related to the time value element of its fair value hedging instruments. This
amount is included in other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

                                      35             (2001 Annual Report p. 62)




<Page>

HEDGE OF NET INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS
The company designates foreign currency derivatives as hedges of net investments
in certain foreign operations. For these hedges unrealized gains and losses are
recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account included in other
comprehensive income (loss), whereas the related amounts due to or from
counterparties are included in other liabilities or other assets.

During 2001, the change in the net unrealized amount was immaterial.

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER SFAS NO. 133
The company has economic hedges that either do not qualify or are not designated
for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133. In addition, AEB enters into
derivative contracts both to meet the needs of its clients and, to a limited
extent, for trading purposes, including taking proprietary positions. For the
year ended December 31, 2001, the net effect on earnings of accounting for the
net changes in fair value of the following undesignated derivatives under SFAS
No. 133 compared with prior rules was immaterial.

- - Foreign currency transaction exposures are economically hedged, where
  practical, through foreign currency contracts. Foreign currency contracts
  involve the purchase and sale of a designated currency at an agreed upon rate
  for settlement on a specified date. Such foreign currency forward contracts
  entered into by the company generally mature within one year. In addition,
  for selected major overseas markets, the company uses foreign currency
  forward contracts with maturities generally not exceeding one year to hedge
  future operating results. In the latter parts of 2001 and 2000, foreign
  currency forward sales (with notional amounts of $323 million and $386
  million, respectively) and, in the latter part of 2000, foreign currency
  forward purchases (with notional amounts of $92 million) were contracted to
  manage a portion of anticipated cash flows from operations in major overseas
  markets for the subsequent year. The impact of these activities was not
  material.

- - AEFA uses interest rate caps, swaps and floors to protect the margin between
  the interest rates earned on investments and the interest rates credited to
  holders of certain investment certificates and fixed annuities.

- - Certain of AEFA's annuity and investment certificate products have returns
  tied to the performance of equity markets. These elements are considered
  derivatives under SFAS No. 133. AEFA manages this equity market risk by
  entering into options and futures with offsetting characteristics.

- - Certain of the company's equity investments are in the form of warrants. Some
  of these warrants are deemed to be derivative financial instruments.

See Note 7 for further information regarding the company's use of interest rate
products related to short- and long-term debt obligations.

NOTE 11 - OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS

The company's off-balance sheet financial instruments principally relate to
extending credit to satisfy the needs of its clients. The contractual amount of
these instruments represents the maximum potential credit risk, assuming the
contract amount is fully utilized, the counterparty defaults and collateral held
is worthless. Management does not expect any material adverse consequence to the
company's financial position to result from these contracts.

The company is committed to extend credit to certain Cardmembers as part of
established lending product agreements. Many of these are not expected to be
drawn; therefore, total unused credit available to Cardmembers does not
represent future cash requirements. The company's Charge Card products have no
preset spending limit and are not reflected in unused credit available to
Cardmembers.

The company issues commercial and other letters of credit to facilitate
the short-term trade-related needs of its banking clients, which typically
mature within six months. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the company held $583
million and $687 million, respectively, of collateral supporting standby
letters of credit and guarantees and $159 million and $242 million,
respectively, of collateral supporting commercial and other letters of credit.
In addition to the contingencies and commitments listed above, the company has
entered into many other contracts in the normal course of business that
involve future cash payments that are either required or contingent upon the
occurrence of certain events.

Other financial institutions have committed to extend lines of credit to the
company of $13.8 billion and $12.4 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

The company leases certain office facilities and operating equipment under
noncancellable and cancellable agreements. Total rental expense amounted to
$491 million, $477 million and $452 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. At December 31, 2001, the minimum aggregate rental commitment
under all noncancellable leases (net of subleases) was (millions): 2002,
$354; 2003, $284; 2004, $210; 2005, $175; 2006, $146; and thereafter, $1,568.

The company is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that, in the opinion
of management, would have a material adverse effect on the company's financial
position.

NOTE 12 - FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following table discloses fair value information for financial instruments.
Certain items, such as life insurance obligations, employee benefit obligations
and investments accounted for under the equity method are excluded. The fair
values of financial instruments are estimates based upon market conditions and
perceived risks at December 31, 2001 and 2000 and require management judgment.
These figures may not be indicative of their future fair values.

(a)  EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2001, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 133, WHICH REQUIRES
     ALL DERIVATIVES TO BE RECOGNIZED AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ON THE
     BALANCE SHEET AND BE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. CONSEQUENTLY, DERIVATIVE
     FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR WHICH
     CARRYING VALUES APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUES FOR 2001.

                                      37             (2001 Annual Report p. 64)




<Page>

The carrying and fair values of off-balance sheet financial instruments are not
material as of December 31, 2001 and 2000. See Note 4 for carrying and fair
value information regarding investments. The following methods were used to
estimate the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities:

FINANCIAL ASSETS
Assets for which carrying values approximate fair values include cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable and accrued interest, separate account assets,
certain other assets, and, for 2001, derivative financial instruments.

Generally, investments are carried at fair value on the Balance Sheet. Gains and
losses are recognized in the results of operations upon disposition of the
securities. In addition, losses are also recognized when management determines
that a decline in value is not temporary.

For variable rate loans that reprice within a year where there has been no
significant change in counterparties' creditworthiness, fair values are based on
carrying values.

The fair values of all other loans, except those with significant credit
deterioration, are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on
current interest rates for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar
credit quality. For loans with significant credit deterioration, fair values are
based on estimates of future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with
the risk inherent in the revised cash flow projections, or for collateral
dependent loans, on collateral values.

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Liabilities for which carrying values approximate fair values include customers'
deposits, travelers cheques outstanding, accounts payable, short-term debt,
certain other liabilities, and, for 2001, derivative financial instruments.

Fair values of fixed annuities in deferral status are estimated as the
accumulated value less applicable surrender charges and loans. For annuities in
payout status, fair value is estimated using discounted cash flows, based on
current interest rates. The fair value of these reserves excludes life
insurance-related elements of $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion in 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

For variable rate investment certificates that reprice within a year, fair
values approximate carrying values. For other investment certificates, fair
value is estimated using discounted cash flows based on current interest rates.
The valuations are reduced by the amount of applicable surrender charges and
related loans.

For variable rate long-term debt that reprices within a year, fair values
approximate carrying values. For other long-term debt, fair value is estimated
using either quoted market prices or discounted cash flows based on the
company's current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing.

Fair values of separate account liabilities, after excluding life insurance
related elements of $3.0 billion and $3.6 billion in 2001 and 2000,
respectively, are estimated as the accumulated value less applicable surrender
charges.

NOTE 13 - SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

A credit concentration may exist if customers are involved in similar
industries. The company's customers operate in diverse economic sectors.
Therefore, management does not expect any material adverse consequences to the
company's financial position to result from credit concentrations. Certain
distinctions between categories require management judgment. The following table
represents the company's maximum credit exposure by industry at December 31,
2001 and 2000:

NOTE 14 - STOCK PLANS

Under the 1998 Incentive Compensation Plan and previously under the 1989
Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plans), awards may be granted to officers, other
key employees and other key individuals who perform services for the company and
its participating subsidiaries. These awards may be in the form of stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance grants and
similar awards designed to meet the requirements of non-U.S. jurisdictions. The
company also has options outstanding pursuant to a Directors' Stock Option Plan.
Under these plans, there were a total of 48 million, 88 million and 123 million
common shares available for grant at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Each option has an exercise price at least equal to the market
price of the company's common stock on the date of grant and a maximum term of
10 years. Options granted prior to 1999 generally vest at 33 1/3 percent per
year beginning with the first anniversary of the grant date. Starting in 1999,
options granted generally vest at 33 1/3 percent per year beginning with the
second anniversary of the grant date. The company also sponsors the American
Express Incentive Savings Plan, under which purchases of the company's common
shares are made by or on behalf of participating employees.

In 1998, the Compensation and Benefits Committee adopted a restoration stock
option program applicable to existing and future stock option awards. This
program provides that employees who exercise options that have been outstanding
at least five years by surrendering previously owned shares as payment will
automatically receive a new (restoration) stock option with an exercise price
equal to the market price on the date of exercise. The size of the restoration
option is equal to the number of shares surrendered plus any shares surrendered
or withheld to satisfy the employees' income tax requirements. The term of the
restoration option, which is exercisable six months after grant, is equal to the
remaining life of the original option. Senior officers must be in compliance
with their stock ownership guidelines to exercise restoration options.

The company granted 3.0 million, 1.5 million and 1.3 million restricted stock
awards (RSAs) with a weighted average grant date value of $35.48, $43.46 and
$36.25 per share for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Restrictions generally
expire four years from date of grant. The compensation cost that has been
charged against income for the company's restricted stock awards was $36
million, $41 million and $38 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

                                      39             (2001 Annual Report p. 66)




<Page>

The company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees," and related Interpretations in accounting for its employee
stock options. Therefore, no compensation cost has been recognized related to
stock options. If the company had elected to account for its stock options under
the fair value method of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," the company's net income and earnings per common share would have
been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions used for grants in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively:

Expected life of stock option               5 years      5 years      5 years
=============================================================================
</Table>

The dividend yield reflects the assumption that the current dividend payout will
continue with no anticipated increases. The expected life of the options is
based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns
that may occur. The weighted average fair value per option was $14.69, $14.92
and $11.09 for options granted during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

NOTE 15 -  RETIREMENT PLANS

PENSION PLANS
The company sponsors the American Express Retirement Plan (the Plan), a
noncontributory defined benefit plan which is a qualified plan under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), under which
the cost of retirement benefits for eligible employees in the United States is
measured by length of service, compensation and other factors and is currently
being funded through a trust. Funding of retirement costs for the Plan complies
with the applicable minimum funding requirements specified by ERISA. Employees'
accrued benefits are based on recordkeeping account balances which are
maintained for each individual and are credited with additions equal to a
percentage, based on age plus service, of base pay, certain commissions and
bonuses, overtime and shift differential, each pay period. Employees' balances
are also credited daily with a fixed rate of interest that is updated each
January 1 and is based on the average of the daily five-year U.S. Treasury Note
yields for the previous October 1 through November 30. Employees have the option
to receive annuity payments or a lump sum payout at vested termination or
retirement.

In addition, the company sponsors an unfunded non-qualified Supplemental
Retirement Plan (the SRP) for certain highly compensated employees to replace
the benefit that cannot be provided by the Plan. The SRP generally parallels the
Plan but offers different payment options.

Most employees outside the United States are covered by local retirement plans,
some of which are funded, or receive payments at the time of retirement or
termination under applicable labor laws or agreements.

Plan assets consist principally of equities and fixed income securities.

The components of the net pension cost for all defined benefit plans accounted
for under SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," are as follows:

<Page>

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value
of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in
excess of plan assets were $612 million, $553 million and $326 million,
respectively, as of December 31, 2001, and $191 million, $171 million and $16
million, respectively, as of December 31, 2000. As a result of a significant
decrease in the fair value of plan assets in certain non-U.S. pension plans,
more plans had an accumulated benefit obligation that exceeded the fair value of
the plan assets, and a minimum liability adjustment was required.

The prior service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average
remaining service period of active participants. Gains and losses in excess of
10 percent of the greater of the benefit obligation and the market-related value
of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active
participants.

The weighted average assumptions used in the company's defined benefit plans
were:

</Table>

The company also has a defined contribution retirement plan (a 401(k) savings
plan with a profit sharing feature) covering most employees in the United
States. The defined contribution plan expense was $76 million, $151 million and
$131 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
The company sponsors postretirement benefit plans that provide health care, life
insurance and other postretirement benefits to retired U.S. employees. Net
periodic postretirement benefit expenses were $25 million, $26 million and $20
million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The liabilities recognized on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets for the company's defined postretirement benefit
plans (other than pension plans) at December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $212 million
and $211 million, respectively.

NOTE 16 - INCOME TAXES

The (benefits) provisions for income taxes were as follows:

Accumulated net earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, which totaled $2.1
billion at December 31, 2001, are intended to be permanently reinvested outside
the United States. Accordingly, federal taxes, which would have aggregated $312
million, have not been provided on those earnings.

The current and deferred components of the provision for income taxes were as
follows:

Net deferred tax assets               $ 1,951                  $ 1,477
======================================================================
</Table>

Deferred tax assets for 2001 and 2000 are primarily related to reserves not yet
deducted for tax purposes of $2.8 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively;
deferred Cardmember fees of $278 million and $254 million, respectively;
deferred compensation of $344 million and $370 million, respectively; and, for
2000, deferred taxes related to SFAS No. 115 of $71 million. Deferred tax
liabilities for 2001 and 2000 are mainly related to deferred acquisition costs
of $1,025 million and $987 million, respectively; depreciation and amortization
of $413 million and $323 million, respectively; deferred taxes related to SFAS
No. 140 (which superceded SFAS No. 125) of $181 million and $111 million,
respectively; and, for 2001, deferred taxes related to SFAS No. 115 of $172
million.

The principal reasons that the aggregate income tax provision is different from
that computed by using the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent are as follows:

NOTE 17 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed using the average actual shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is basic EPS adjusted for the
dilutive effect of stock options, RSAs and other financial instruments that may
be converted into common shares. The basic and diluted EPS computations are as
follows:

NOTE 18 - OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC OPERATIONS

OPERATING SEGMENTS
The company is principally engaged in providing travel related, financial
advisory and international banking services throughout the world. TRS' products
and services include, among others, Charge Cards, Cardmember lending products,
Travelers Cheques, and corporate and consumer travel services. AEFA's services
and products include financial planning and advice, investment advisory services
and a variety of products, including insurance and annuities, investment
certificates and mutual funds. AEB's products and services include providing
private, financial institution and corporate banking, personal financial
services and global trading. The company operates on a global basis, although
the principal market for financial advisory services is the United States.

The following table presents certain information regarding these operating
segments at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 and for each of the years then
ended. The segment results have been affected by charges discussed in Notes 2
and 3. For certain income statement items that are affected by asset
securitizations at TRS, data is provided on both a managed basis, which excludes
the effect of securitizations, as well as on a GAAP basis. See Note 6 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements and the TRS Results of Operations section of
the Financial Review for further information regarding the effect of
securitizations on the financial statements. In addition, net revenues (managed
basis) are presented net of provisions for losses and benefits for annuities,
insurance and investment certificate products of AEFA.

Income tax provision (benefit) is calculated on a separate return basis;
however, benefits from operating losses, loss carrybacks and tax credits
(principally foreign tax credits) recognizable for the company's consolidated
reporting purposes are allocated based upon the tax sharing agreement among
members of the American Express Company consolidated U.S. tax group.

Assets are those that are used or generated exclusively by each industry
segment. The adjustments and eliminations required to determine the consolidated
amounts shown above consist principally of the elimination of inter-segment
amounts.

Most services of the company are provided on an integrated worldwide basis.
Therefore, it is not practical to separate precisely the U.S. and international
services. Accordingly, the data in the above table are, in part, based upon
internal allocations, which necessarily involve management's judgment.

NOTE 19 - TRANSFER OF FUNDS FROM SUBSIDIARIES

The SEC requires the disclosure of certain restrictions on the flow of funds to
a parent company from its subsidiaries in the form of loans, advances or
dividends.

Restrictions on the transfer of funds exist under debt agreements and regulatory
requirements of certain of the company's subsidiaries. These restrictions have
not had any effect on the company's shareholder dividend policy and management
does not anticipate any effect in the future.

At December 31, 2001, the aggregate amount of net assets of subsidiaries that
may be transferred to the Parent Company was approximately $8.6 billion. Should
specific additional needs arise, procedures exist to permit immediate transfer
of short-term funds between the company and its subsidiaries, while complying
with the various contractual and regulatory constraints on the internal transfer
of funds.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Express
Company as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the management of American Express Company. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of American Express
Company at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.
